I. INTRODUCTION
This paper examines a simple agency problem where an agent chooses
effort levels that positively influence the individual productivity, but
create disutility. This framework leads to a moral hazard problem that can
be effectively mitigated by a principal's incentive mechanism. We add
aggregate risk so that the state of the macroeconomy can influence both
the agent's and principal's choices. In particular, it is important to include
relevant information about the state of the macroeconomy, say a recession
or an expansion, in the information set of the parties involved in
contractual relationships under asymmetric information, and to understand
how this information can affect choices and contract between parties.
The basic framework under moral hazard involves endogenous partial
risk sharing of the idiosyncratic risk between the agent and the principal.
We take a step further by considering the implications of the agent
preference towards effort conditional on aggregate risk. This is an
important problem because a fundamental ambiguity arises in the
correlation between individual preferences towards effort and the
aggregate state of the economy, say a recession or an expansion.
The problem is as follows: Suppose the macroeconomy is experiencing
an expansion, say the aggregate state is good; then it is likely that the
disutility created by effort varies relative to the case of a recession, i.e. the
bad aggregate state. However, the variation can be plausibly positive,
negative or null.1 This creates a fundamental ambiguity in individual

For example, the relative magnitudes of substitution and wealth effects can easily give
variation in any direction.

preference towards effort in the presence of aggregate risk. This
fundamental ambiguity impacts upon the contractual relationship between
principal and agent creating an important and subtle incompleteness in the
contract. The contractual incompleteness is due to transactions costs
involved in predicting and/or describing the ambiguity in the agent's
preference towards effort, and it is in the spirit of the contract
incompleteness discussed in Hart and Moore (1999).2
In turn, a risk averse agent can use its own behavior towards effort in
utility, conditional on aggregate risk, to further transfer idiosyncratic risk
to the principal. The main result of the paper is that when the individual
preference towards effort and the aggregate risk are negatively correlated,
the agent can effectively further diversify individual risk and increase
expected utility. In the traditional mean-variance framework, idiosyncratic
risk is fully diversifiable under full information. With asymmetric
information, in the principal-agent framework of this paper, we show that
a mean-variance (expected utility vs. idiosyncratic risk) tradeoff may
endogenously emerge as the individual preference towards effort varies
positively with aggregate risk.3

2

Hart and Moore (1999) base contract incompleteness upon the ability to describe events
and states of nature; in this paper the incompleteness is based on the transactions costs
that arise given the possible ambiguity of a fundamental preference parameter of the
agent's utility conditional upon aggregate risk.
3
The ambiguity of the effect of aggregate risk on heterogeneous individuals is examined
in a dynamic adverse selection model in Bianconi (2003a). Here, we focus on a different
case or the effect of aggregate risk on individual preference towards effort under moral
hazard. Phelan (1994) is an important contribution which examines private information in
the class of overlapping generation dynamic models with aggregate risk. See also more
recently Altissimo and Zaffaroni (2003) for an empirical investigation of the relationship
between aggregate risk and individual heterogeneity using PSID data.

We first study the effects of the alternative preference towards effort
conditional on aggregate risk analytically. However, the analytical results
are restricted by nonlinearities and complexity, even in the simple static
setting. In particular, we are able to obtain analytical results that are partial
equilibrium. The crucial general equilibrium effects are then obtained
through a quantitative assessment of the model and they reveal important
limitations of the partial equilibrium analysis.4
In this framework, individual consumption is less than perfectly
correlated and more volatile than aggregate consumption which provides a
step in the right direction to explain the equity premium puzzle. Thus, we
also examine the implications of alternative preference towards effort on
the risk-free return and the risk premium. Using the moral hazard model
with incomplete risk sharing, Kahn (1990) had shown that moral hazard
can plausibly increase the risk premium. Kocherlakota (1998) showed that
once Khan's arbitrary restrictions on the set of traded assets were removed,
the effect on the equity premium becomes negligible. Our contribution
here is to examine how individual preference towards effort, conditional
on aggregate risk, impacts on the risk-free return and risk premium under
moral hazard.5 We find that adding the aggregate risk channel on
individual preferences can mitigate the moral hazard (upward) effect on
the risk premium, i.e. it can move the premium downwards because there

The problem studied here is specific to agency under moral hazard. However, the
ambiguity of individual preference towards aggregate states is fairly general, for
example, in manager/worker relationships involving teams.

may be less demand for assets to diversify idiosyncratic risk. However, the
effects are quantitatively small.
The paper is organized as follows. In section II we present the basic
framework and the agency problem. Section III presents the main
analytical results of the effect of variation in individual preference towards
effort, conditional on aggregate risk, on the agency relationship. Section
IV presents the analytical risk-free and risk premium implications. Section
V is the quantitative evaluation of the general equilibrium effects, while
section VI concludes.
II. BASIC MODEL AND AGENCY
We consider economies populated by a large number of individuals with
each individual denoted by the name i. Individuals may have private
information about their work effort in the production of a single good. In
particular, there may be an infinite number of actions/effort taken by the
individual so that the action/effort is unobserved by the general public.
Systematic or aggregate risk is denoted by the aggregate state variable,

θ, which affects the distribution of the agent’s output, conditional upon the
unobserved work effort. Individuals can observe the aggregate state, θ,
before their choice of work effort, thus making work effort contingent
upon the aggregate state.6
The production side is as follows. Each individual named i chooses a
state contingent action/effort, denoted e(θ )≥ 0, in order to operate a
6
The intuition is that an individual's work effort choice is made conditional upon the
aggregate state as given. For example, an individual starts the workday under a given
aggregate state making effort choices conditional on the aggregate state.

production technology that yields individual stochastic output denoted y.
The individual output has two possible outcomes,
yz , for z = g ("good"), b ("bad").
The probability distribution of the individual output is binomial, and
assumed to depend upon the state contingent work effort as:
yg with probability p(e( θ );θ ),
yb with probability 1- p(e( θ );θ );
yg > yb all i
where p(e(θ );θ )> 0 is a strictly increasing and strictly concave function
of effort, e(θ ), contingent on the aggregate state, or p’ >0, p”<0.
Intuitively, the larger (lower) the work effort for a given aggregate state,
the larger (lower) the probability of higher output produced by the
individual. The function p is well defined and is dependent on the
aggregate state θ. Also, given the aggregate state, the individual
exogenous output in the "good" state, yg, is uniformly higher than in the
"bad" state, yb. Thus, the aggregate state has an affect on the individual
productivity through the probability function p, so that effort is also a
function of the aggregate state.
Aggregate or systematic risk is assumed to follow a binomial
distribution as well. The average or aggregate per individual output is
denoted Yθ, for θ =G,B. The probability distribution of average output is
given by
YG with probability p ,
YB with probability 1- p ;
6

YG > YB
where p≥ 0 is a simple probability. Average (aggregate per individual)
output is endogenously determined as
YG = p(e(G);G) yg + [1-p(e(G);G)] yb

(1a)

YB = p(e(B);B) yg + [1-p(e(B);B)] yb .

(1b)

Expressions (1a,b) simply state average output as a linear combination of
individual outputs. In particular, (1a,b) show that average output is an
increasing function of the effort supplied by the individual. We can easily
compute the mean and variance of aggregate and individual output in this
economy as
E[Y] = p YG + (1-p ) YB = E[y]

(2a)

var (Y ) = p (1-p ) (YG - YB ) 2

(2b)

var(y )= [p p(e(G);G)+(1-p ) p(e(B);B)] ×
[1-p p(e(G);G)-(1-p ) p(e(B);B)] (yg - yb )2

(2c)

where we used the law of large numbers to express the dependence on the
individual type z =g,b only through Yθ , given in (1a,b), and the average
aggregate and individual output are identical. Henceforth, given effort, the
effect of the aggregate state on the individual productivity is given by
p(e(.);G) > p(e(.);B)

(3)

determining the impact of aggregate risk on individual productivity and
consequently on effort.
The demand side is as follows. An individual derives utility from
consumption of the single good and disutility from effort according to an
additively separable function
7

U = u (cz(θ )) – v(e (θ );θ )

(4)

where cz(θ ) is the individual state contingent consumption, and u is
strictly increasing and strictly concave, u’ >0, u”<0, i.e. an individual is
assumed to be risk averse regarding the consumption prospect.
The function v captures (dis)utility of effort, and it is assumed strictly
increasing and convex, v’ >0, v”≥ 0 in effort. It could be linear in effort,
indicating the special case where the individual is risk neutral regarding
the disutility of labor. The function v also depends on the aggregate state

θ. As we will see in more detail below, this is meant to capture possible
differences in the agent’s disutility of labor depending on the aggregate
state. In particular, allowing an agent to choose her preference towards
effort in the presence of aggregate risk can provide an additional channel
to diversify idiosyncratic risk and explore a tradeoff between mean and
variance. While the principal can observe the aggregate state,θ, when
offering a contract, she cannot observe how the agent chooses preference
toward effort in the presence of aggregate risk. This is the source of
fundamental ambiguity, or incompleteness, in the principal-agent
relationship and can be plausibly caused by transactions costs in explicitly
writing such contract clauses.
The expected utility, over individual type z and aggregate state θ, of a
consumer i is given by
E[U] = p { p(e(G);G) u (cg (G)) + [1-p(e(G);G)] u (cb (G)) –
v(a(G);G)} + (1-p) { p(e(B);B) u (cg(B)) +
[1-p(e(B);B)] u (cb(B)) – v(a(B);B) }.
8

(5)

Given the moments in (2a,b,c), we note that E[Y]=E[C], var(C)=var(Y)
and that the variance of individual consumption is
var(c)= p { p(e(G);G)(cg (G)-E[C])2 + [1-p(e(G);G)](cb (G)-E[C])2} +
(1-p) { p(e(B);B)(cg (B)-E[C])2 + [1-p(e(B);B)](cb (B)-E[C])2}

(2d)

The variance (or standard deviation) of individual consumption will be the
measure of idiosyncratic risk borne by the agent. Thus, a tradeoff may
emerge between more or less expected utility (more or less mean) and
more or less risk (more or less variance of individual consumption).
The agency structure is as follows. An individual (agent) negotiates
with a principal a consumption bundle subject to idiosyncratic and
aggregate risk. Due to risk aversion, individuals want to minimize the
idiosyncratic risk in their consumption bundle by sharing this risk with the
principal. The principal is assumed to play the role of a benevolent planner
by maximizing the expected utility of the agent over idiosyncratic and
aggregate risk in expression (5).
The basic setup is simple enough to accommodate a linear sharing
rule.7 Because there are two aggregate and two idiosyncratic states (2¥2
case), the principal can basically offer a linear sharing rule contingent
upon the final observable outcomes yz and Yθ. In particular, we can
postulate a linear consumption rule for an individual i, of the form
cz ( θ ) = aθ yz + (1-aθ ) Y θ , each θ =G,B; z =g,b

(6)

where aθ∈[0,1] is a choice variable in the principal’s problem of
maximizing the expected utility of the agent subject to the appropriate
7

Linear sharing rules under moral hazard and their optimality are surveyed in Holmstrom
and Hart (1987), and more recently in Bianconi (2003b).

incentive compatibility constraints. In effect, a determines the extent of
risk sharing between the principal and the agent. If a =0, all idiosyncratic
risk is borne by the principal and the agent is fully insured against
idiosyncratic risk. If a =1, all idiosyncratic risk is borne by the agent and
the principal does not bear any idiosyncratic risk. When a∈(0,1) it
determines the level of endogenous risk sharing among the parties.
III. CONTRACTS, AGGREGATE RISK AND IDIOSYNCRATIC
RISK, AND INDIVIDUAL PREFERENCE
The level of effort of the individual is assumed to be continuous. We thus
apply the First Order approach, e.g. Rogerson (1985), Jewitt (1988), and
obtain the appropriate incentive compatibility constraint.8 The appropriate
incentive compatibility constraint is the one that maximizes the expected
utility, over individual type z, by choice of the level of effort e(θ ) of an
individual, subject to consumption following the linear sharing rule given
in (4), all conditional on the aggregate state q, and taking the principal's
share parameter a as given (hence taking consumption as given). The
problem may be written as
Max p(e(θ );θ ) u(cg (θ )) + [1-p (e (θ );θ )] u(cb (θ )) – v(e (θ );θ )

(7)

{e (θ )≥ 0}
subject to (6),

8

The First Order approach is well defined in this case given the properties of the
probability function p, i.e. strictly increasing and strictly concave.

10

with {aθ ,Yθ } taken as given by the agent. Substituting the constraint into
the objective function and computing the necessary first order conditions
of the resulting unconstrained problem yields the expression
p’(e (θ );θ )[ u (aθ yg+ (1-aθ )Yθ ) – u (aθ yb + (1-aθ )Yθ )]= v’(e (θ );θ ),
all θ.

(8)

The solution in (8) is familiar from asymmetric information problems
where the tradeoff between incentives and risk sharing arises, e.g.
Holmstrom (1979). The first best would be to provide full insurance to the
risk averse individual over the idiosyncratic (non-systematic) risk, i.e. full
risk sharing. Full insurance for the idiosyncratic risk in this context
implies that aθ =0 for all θ. This is because with aq =0 in (6), consumption
is just the average across individuals, cz (θ )=Yθ , for each θ =G,B and all z
=g,b. This implies, from expression (8) that
v’ (e (θ );θ ) / p’(e (θ );θ ) Æ 0, all θ ¤

v’Æ 0 or p’Æ• .

(9)

Hence, expression (9) shows that under the first best or full insurance
for the idiosyncratic risk, the effort is minimum, eÆ 0, since the agent has
no incentive to provide effort, i.e. the classic moral hazard or free rider
problem. The solution is for the principal to provide partial insurance to
the individual idiosyncratic risk, a∈(0,1). In the second best with partial
insurance, the agent has an incentive to provide effort above the minimum
level, and we observe the usual tradeoff between incentive and risk
sharing.
The principal’s problem is to maximize expected utility over individual
and aggregate risk. First, the principal has the advantage of recognizing
11

that its own actions have an effect on the effort of the agent, i.e. a has an
impact on e. Second, the principal does not recognize the effect of
aggregate risk, θ, on the agent's preference, v; i.e. the principal observes θ
but cannot observe the way the agent chooses the correlation between v
and θ . Hence, the effect of aggregate risk on the agent's preference is
assumed to be beyond the control of the principal and the transactions
costs associated with writing contracts is a plausible motive for this
assumption, as in the work of Hart (1995) and Battigalli and Maggi
(2002). The principal's problem is
Max{aθ∈(0,1)} π {p( (G);G) u(cg (G)) + [1-p (e (G))] u(cb (G)) – v(e (G);G)}+
(1-π){p( (B);B) u(cg (B)) + [1-p (e (B))] u(cb (B)) – v(e (B);B)}

(10)

subject to (1a,b),(4), and (6),
The necessary first order condition is given by
p(e(.);.) u’(cg (.))[yg –Y(.) ] + [1-p(e(.);.)] u’(cb(.)) [yb –Y(.) ] +[∂ e/∂ a (.)]×
{ p’(e(.);.) [u (cg (.))-u (cb (.))] + (1-a(.) ) p(e(.);.)×
[u’(cg (.))-u’(cb (.))] p’(e(.);.)(yg –yb ) - v’(e(.);.)} = 0,

each θ.

(11)

where {cg (.),Y(.) } can be substituted from (1a,b) and (6), and [∂ e/∂ a (.)]
is computed from (8) as
[∂ e/∂ a (.)] = p’(e(.);.) { u’(cb (.))[yb –Y(.) ] - u’(cg(.)) [yg –Y(.) ]} /
p”(e(.);.) [u(cg (.)) - u(cb(.))] + p’(e(.);.)2 (1-a(.) )[u’(cg (.))-u’(cb (.))]×
p’(e(.);.)(yg –yb ) - v”(e(.);.),

each θ.

(12)

Expressions (11)-(12) provide a solution for a∈(0,1). We can show that
the term [∂ e/∂ a (.)]>0 is strictly positive so that, all else constant, as a
12

increases and the agent bears more of the idiosyncratic risk, there is an
incentive to provide more effort thus increasing the probability of the best
outcome to occur. This is the main tool used by the principal to induce
effort on the part of the agent.
In this paper, we focus on a potential incompleteness of the contractual
relationship presented above. The agent cannot affect the principal’s
choice of the share a and thus cannot directly affect its own consumption
for the choice of effort in problem (7). However, the existence of
aggregate risk and the potential dependency of v on θ may allow the agent
to affect its own consumption and thus the share α. In other words, the
agent may use its own preference towards effort, in particular the
curvature v”(e(.);θ ), for a given level of effort, to affect the magnitude of
[∂ e/∂ a (.)] in its own best interest of insuring against idiosyncratic risk
and increasing expected utility. While the contractual relationship is
designed to give incentives for the agent to provide high effort, it comes to
the agent at a cost of partial insurance to the idiosyncratic risk. The agent
can use its own preferences towards effort to mitigate these costs, thus
transferring some risk back to the principal. The agent may be able to
explore a potential incompleteness in the contract regarding preference
towards effort in the presence of aggregate risk, thus effectively using
aggregate risk to diversify the idiosyncratic risk. It is important to note
that, even when the principal cannot observe the agent's choice for the cost
of effort, the solution to the problem continues to be subgame perfect
since chosen effort is what in fact the agent reports to the principal, i.e. the

13

report is truthful.9 In effect, the principal infers a preference parameter
from the agent, say an implied curvature v”(e(.);θ ), but cannot distinguish
whether the parameter is due to the intensity of effort or due to the change
in preference through aggregate risk, given the level of effort. It is this
second channel that is the source of fundamental contractual
incompleteness which can be explored by the agent in its best interest.
The incompleteness is based on the fact that an agent’s behavior can be
fundamentally ambiguous regarding the way aggregate risk affects the
(dis)utility of effort. Suppose an agent starts under a good aggregate state,
say a boom in the macroeconomy. Its own (dis)utility of effort could vary
in two potential distinctive ways:
(i) The aggregate state is good and, for each level of effort, the agent
derives higher disutility of effort, say the v function becomes close to
linear or v"(e(.);θ )→ 0, and the agent has less incentive to provide effort,
preference toward effort and the aggregate state are negatively
correlated;10
(ii) The aggregate state is good and, for each level of effort, the agent
derives lower disutility of effort, say the v function becomes more convex
or v"(e(.);θ )>0, and the agent has more incentive to provide effort,
preference toward effort and the aggregate state are positively correlated.

9
Subgame perfect equilibrium refers to the consistency between the principal and agent
behavior under contractual agreement. See for example Kreps (1990) for a discussion of
the subgame perfect equilibrium concept.
10
Recall that the probability function of the individual also changes with the aggregate
state, being the way aggregate risk impacts on the individual productivity in production,
e.g. equation (3).

14

This fundamental source of ambiguity is the source of contractual
incompleteness, and it is assumed beyond the principal’s control. It thus
can be effectively used by the agent to diversify idiosyncratic risk
measured by both the share α and the variance of consumption, var(c).11
We can compute the local effect of a small change in the aggregate
state on the expected utility of the individual, from expression (4), where
the agent cannot affect the consumption bundle provided by the principal,
thus obtaining

∂ E[U]/∂ θ = [∂ p(.;θ )/∂ θ] [u(cg (.)) - u(cb(.))] - [∂ v(.;θ )/∂ θ], all θ (13)
where we made use of the Envelope theorem to eliminate the effect on
effort. All else constant, it is clear that ∂ v(.;θ )/∂θ <0 is in the best interest
of the agent by increasing the magnitude of the change in expected
utility.12 The case ∂ v(.;θ )/∂θ <0 means that it is in the best interest of the
agent to provide more effort in the good aggregate state, case (ii) above. In
effect, setting ∂ v(.;θ )/∂θ <0 implies that v”(.;θ ) is larger in magnitude
(more curvature in the function) and by inspection of expression (12), we
note that the magnitude of [∂ e/∂ a (.)] is also lowered. This in turn
confirms that the principal’s main tool to induce effort on the agent
becomes less effective allowing the agent to bear less idiosyncratic risk for

11

As mentioned above, transactions costs are a plausible motive for the lack of principal's
control over individual preferences, e.g. Hart (1995) and Battigalli and Maggi (2002);
and the contractual incompleteness is in the spirit of Hart and Moore (1999).
12

When consumption is a function of effort directly, without the principal’s involvement
or full information, the effect of ∂ v(.;θ)/∂ θ <0 would be mitigated by the strict
concavity of the utility function in consumption. This can be easily seen in the context of
effort choice, say a Robinson Crusoe case, where given the strict concavity of utility of
consumption ∂ v(.;θ)/∂ θ <0 would decrease expected utility, not increase it.

15

each level of effort. The case ∂ v(.;θ )/∂θ >0 means that the agent provides
more effort in the bad aggregate state, case (i) above; v”(.;θ ) is smaller in
magnitude (less curvature in the function) and [∂ e/∂ a (.)] increases. One
way or the other, it confirms that the principal’s main tool to induce effort
on the agent may be affected.
It is important to recognize that the agent takes consumption as given,
so the effects discussed above are partial equilibrium. The particular
choice of ∂ v(.;θ )/∂θ <0 by the agent will have an ultimate effect on
consumption through the principal’s choice of a. However, it will also
have an effect on the variance of individual consumption. The general
equilibrium effects are important because while in expression (13), setting

∂ v(.;θ )/∂θ <0 is beneficial for expected utility, it may or may not have a
detrimental effect on the variance of individual consumption, hence a
mean-variance tradeoff may emerge. We evaluate the general equilibrium
effects numerically in section V, given the complexity and nonlinearities
involved in the analytical evaluation of the general equilibrium effects.
IV. ASSET RETURNS
Under the arrangements described in section III, we can now describe
optimal state contingent consumption in terms of a portfolio of assets. We
let an individual hold a portfolio with three assets.
First, we have a private asset subject to the own individual risk, then
we have two other macro assets. The characteristics of the assets are as
follows: (i) The private risky asset yields the return yz representing the
own individual risk; (ii) One aggregate risky asset yields the average per
16

individual output, Yθ , representing aggregate macro risk; and (iii) The
other macro asset is a risk-free asset yielding the risk-free total return Rf,
in zero supply. Therefore, the state contingent individual consumption is
replicated by holding a portfolio with the three assets expressed as
cz (θ )=aθ yz +(1-aθ )[sYθ +(1-s)R f ], each θ =G,B; z =g,b

(14)

where sŒ[0,1] is the share of the risky asset in the portfolio of macro
assets. Indeed, aŒ[0,1], measures the extent of partial risk sharing
between the principal and the agent.
The first question is the extent to which the introduction of moral
hazard affects asset returns, e.g. Kahn (1990), Kocherlakota (1998). The
most important question here is the effect the agent’s use of preference
towards effort to diversify idiosyncratic risk has on asset returns. Towards
an answer, first we consider the risk-free return, Rf. We obtain the
endogenous value for Rf using the zero-level pricing method: Maximize
expected utility of an individual by choice of the share of macro assets, s,
taking the risk-free return, Rf as given. Then, we set the share of the riskfree macro asset on the portfolio to zero, i.e. s=1, and find the appropriate
Rf that makes the risk-free asset in zero supply, i.e. the value of the asset
is the appropriate shadow value that makes the agent indifferent between
owning it or not. The specific problem may be written as
Max{s∈[0,1]} p {p(e(G);G)u(cg (G))+[1-p(e(G);G)] u(cb (G)) – v(e(G):G)} +
(1-p ) { p(e(B));B) u (cg (B)) + [1-p(e(B);B)] u (cb (B)) – v(e(B);B)}
subject to (14),
taking {aθ , e(θ ), Rf } as given. The necessary first order condition is
17

(15)

p (1-aG )( YG - Rf ) { p(e(G);G) u’(cg(G))+[1-p(e(G);G)] u’(cb(G))} +
(1-p )(1-aB )(YB - Rf ){ p(e(B);B) u’(cg (B))+
[1-p(e(B);B)] u’(cb(B))} = 0

(16)

where cz(.) is given in (14). Applying the zero-level pricing method
involves solving the first order condition (16) for Rf , and evaluating at
s=1, yielding
Rf* = E[ u’(cz (θ )) (1-aθ ) Yθ ] / E[u’(cz (θ ))(1-aθ )]

(17)

where the expectation is over z and θ. The economy with idiosyncratic risk
shows a risk-free return that depends upon the marginal utility of
individual consumption and the linear sharing value, besides the usual
macro factors.
Next, we compute the risk premium E[Y]-Rf*. Using expressions (17),
(2,a,b,c), and the usual covariance decomposition formula, we obtain
E[Y] - Rf* = - cov ( u’ (cz (θ )) (1-aθ ), Yθ ) / E [u’ (cz (q ))(1-aθ )]

(18)

This is a familiar formula for the risk premium except for the presence
of the term relating to the principal's share value (1-a ). When there is no
private information, full insurance (FI) yields a =0, and evaluating at s=1
or cz (θ )=Yθ , the risk premium takes the familiar form
E[Y] - Rf* |FI = - cov ( u’ (Yθ ), Yθ ) / E [u’ (Yθ )].

In practice, the covariance of the marginal utility with the risky asset is
negative since in the good state consumption is high and the marginal
utility is low, i.e. the risk premium is positive. Thus, the higher the
covariance (the less negative), the lower the risk premium.

18

Next, we examine the effect of moral hazard on the risk premium. The
share a >0 is necessary to induce effort, but, at the same time, a >0
affects the asset returns as seen in (18)-(19). With moral hazard, there is
partial insurance for the idiosyncratic risk and agents bear some of their
own idiosyncratic risk in consumption. This implies that, in addition to
aggregate risk, individuals must take into account idiosyncratic risk thus
making the marginal utility more variable relative to the case of full
insurance.
For example, when there is full insurance to the idiosyncratic risk, or a
=0, the risk premium is given in expression (19) and it is equal to the term
-cov(u’(Yq ),Yq )/E[u’(Yq )] (as in the full information case) because
individual consumption cz(θ )=Yθ for all z, and all variation in the
marginal utility comes from the aggregate risk. When there is partial
insurance to the idiosyncratic risk, a >0, there is the additional variation
of the individual idiosyncratic risk in consumption, because cz (θ )πYθ ,
thus increasing the variation of the marginal utility. In this case, the risk
premium is given in (18), and we have that
- cov ( u’ (cz (θ ))(1-aθ ), Yθ ) / E [u’ (cz (θ )) (1-aθ )] ≥
- cov( u’(Yθ ),Y θ )/E[u’(Yθ )]

(20)

exactly because of the additional variation of the marginal utility in the
second best.13 Hence, the risk premium, in the presence of contracts that
13
A proof of inequality (20) can be constructed using arguments analogous to Hansen
and Jagannathan (1991). Using cov(u’(Yθ ),Yθ )=r12s1s2 , for {s1 ,s2 } the standard
deviations of the first and second arguments in the covariance function, and r12 their
correlation; we obtain from (19), E[Y - Rf*] = - r12s1s2 / E [u’ (Yθ )]. Hence,
rearranging and taking absolute values yields | r12 | s1 / E [u’ (Yθ )] = |E[Y - Rf*]| / s2 .
Given that | r12| £ 1, implies s1 / E [u’ (Yθ )] ≥ |E[Y - Rf*]| / s2 , so that a large risk

19

mitigate moral hazard, may be potentially larger relative to the case of full
information.
The crucial issue here is the effect of the fundamental incompleteness
where agents can vary the preference towards effort across aggregate
states. We have examined in section III that, in terms of expected utility
(mean), it is in the best interest of the agent to report ∂ v(.;θ )/∂ θ <0
which implies that [∂ e/∂ a (.)] is lowered, for a given level of effort, i.e. a
is lowered. The key result here is that the variation in preference towards
effort by the agent may mitigate the effect of moral hazard on asset prices
moving the risk premium downwards. The intuition is simple: As a is
lowered, the agent bears less idiosyncratic risk and there is less need to
provide additional premium to the risk averse agent who holds assets.
However, this is partial equilibrium. In general equilibrium, alternative
individual preference towards effort will ultimately lead to a change in the
level and variance of consumption as well, and the premium may move
upwards or downwards depending on the nature of the endogenous meanvariance tradeoff. Hence, alternative individual preference towards effort
may mitigate or enlarge the moral hazard effect on asset returns given in
(20) once general equilibrium effects are fully accounted for.
Next, we provide a quantitative evaluation of the general equilibrium
effects of agents’ variations in preference towards effort under moral
hazard and aggregate risk.

premium is necessarily accompanied by a large standard deviation of the marginal utility.
The marginal utility of cz (θ ) is at least as volatile as the marginal utility of Yθ , see
expression (6), and the proof in complete.

V. QUANTITATIVE EVALUATION
The quantitative evaluation of the model is performed with the following
functional forms. The utility of consumption has the usual CRRA form:
u(c) = c1-ρ /1-ρ,

ρ >0

(21)

where ρ is the coefficient of relative risk aversion.
The probability function p is given by
p(e(.);θ ) = a(θ ) e(.)λ,

λ∈(0,1), all θ

(22)

for a(θ )>0, a free parameter denoting the dependency of the probability
function on the aggregate state, i.e. the way aggregate risk affects the
productivity of individuals [see expression (3)]. The function is strictly
increasing and strictly concave.
The disutility of effort function takes the form
v(e(.);θ ) = e(.)1+δ(θ )/1+δ(θ ),

δ(θ )≥ 0, all θ

(23)

for δ(θ )≥ 0, all θ determining the extent of the effect of the aggregate
state on the function v. Setting δ =0 indicates that total utility is linear in
effort, and given the level of effort as δ increases, say δ >0, the lower the
disutility of effort in total utility. In this latter case, an individual tolerates
more effort when δ increases, i.e. has more “risk aversion” in effort. In
terms of the results discussed in section III, we have a mapping between δ
and ∂ v(.;θ )/∂ θ as
dδ /dθ ö 0 ¤ ∂ v(.;θ )/∂ θ ä 0.

(24)

For a given level of effort e(.), as δ increases (decreases) with the
aggregate state and v"(.;θ) increases or becomes more convex (decreases
21

or becomes less convex), then ∂ v(.;θ )/∂θ <(>)0. This is because as δ
increases (decreases) with the aggregate state, the lower (higher) the
disutility of effort and the higher (lower) the utility, i.e. ∂ v(.;θ )/∂θ <(>)
0.
Hence, the dependency of the parameter δ on the aggregate state
conveniently captures the fundamental ambiguity in preference towards
effort discussed in section III. When δ increases with the aggregate state,
then ∂ v(.;θ )/∂θ <0 and as the macroeconomy is in a good state, the
individual tolerates more effort in preference, and preference and
aggregate state are positively correlated. When δ decreases with the
aggregate state, then ∂ v(.;θ )/∂θ >0 and as the macroeconomy is in a good
state, the individual tolerates less effort in preference, and preference and
aggregate state are negatively correlated. Also, δ may be invariant to the
aggregate state, then ∂ v(.;θ )/∂θ =0; and all cases are plausible.
We evaluate the general equilibrium and asset prices for the economy
by choosing a base parameter set with two basic characteristics: (i) The
standard deviation of individual consumption and output is several times
higher than the standard deviation of aggregate per individual
consumption and output, as in the real world data, see e.g. Deaton (1991,
1992), Pischke (1995); (ii) The parameter space is constrained so that the
probability function is well defined, or p(.;.)∈(0,1).14 We choose a base
parameter set as:

14
The quantitative evaluation is meant to provide a qualitative evaluation of the general
equilibrium effects of individual preference behavior, so that we do not pursue a formal
calibration exercise here.

{δ(G)=δ(B)=4.0;ρ =2.0;λ=0.25;π =0.5;
yg=6.25; yb=0.5; a(G)=0.9; a(B)=0.8}

(25)

which implies a benchmark equilibrium where:
e(G)=0.352

E[Y]=4.240

e(B)=0.332

E[C]=4.240

α(G)=0.104

var(c)=0.120; std(c)=0.347

α(B)=0.071

var(y)=7.520;std(y)=2.742

p(G)=0.694

var(C)=0.062;std(C)=0.249

p(B)=0.607

var(Y)=0.062; std(Y)=0.249

E[U] = -0.240

E[Y]-Rf =0.03

This benchmark equilibrium is one where effort is around and over 1/3,
the extent of risk sharing reflected in α is between 7 and 10%, the
probability of good individual output is between 60 and 70%. The
standard deviation of individual income is about 11 times the standard
deviation of aggregate per individual income, and the standard deviation
of individual consumption is about 1.4 times the standard deviation of
aggregate per individual consumption. Since there is no investment,
aggregate output and consumption are identical and so are their variances.
This is a plausible benchmark to examine the effects of alternative
preferences toward effort in the presence of aggregate risk. The tables
present percentage changes from the benchmark of δ(G)=δ(B)=4.0. Table
1 presents the results where in column I, we increase δ uniformly to

δ(G)=δ(B)=5.0, that is ∂ v(.;θ )/∂θ <0 or v"(e(.):θ ) increases uniformly.
Effort increases across aggregate states by an average of about 18%, the
23

risk sharing measured by α decreases between 2.9 and 5.6%, the
probability of the good state in individual output increases by an average
4.6%. The consumption risk borne by the agent decreases by 1.4% and
expected utility increases by 4.2%. It is clear that, across aggregate states,
the agent can use preference toward effort to counter the principal's main
incentive inducing tool in expression (12), [∂ e/∂ a (.)]>0. The effect on
the risk-free return and premium is rather small. The risk-free return
increases by 16 basis points and the premium remains virtually
unchanged.
The second column, II, presents the case where δ increases in the good
aggregate state only, δ(G)=5.0 and δ(B)=4.0, reflecting behavior of
tolerating more effort when the aggregate state is good and less effort
when the aggregate state is bad; that is ∂ v(.;G)/∂ G<0 or v"(e(.);G)
increases, and preference and aggregate state are positively correlated.
While the effect on effort, risk sharing and probability of success is
symmetric, the effects on the last four rows are instructive. When δ(G)
increases, effort leads to more consumption in the good aggregate state
(the bad aggregate state remains unchanged) and the consumption risk
borne by the agent increases substantially. Even though the risk sharing
amount reflected in α decreases, the agent is not diversifying much of the
idiosyncratic risk because the variation in preference is positively related
to the outcome of the aggregate state. However, expected utility increases,
so that a mean-variance tradeoff emerges.
The results in the highlighted column III illustrate those important
issues. Column III presents the case where δ increases in the bad
24

aggregate state only, δ(B)=5.0 and δ(G)=4.0; that is ∂ v(.;B)/∂ B<0 or
v"(e(.);B) increases. This reflects behavior of tolerating more effort when
the aggregate state is bad and less effort when the aggregate state is good,
i.e. the variation in preference is negatively correlated to the aggregate
outcome. Now, when δ(B) increases, effort leads to more consumption in
the bad aggregate state (the good aggregate state remains unchanged) and
the consumption risk borne by the agent decreases substantially. The agent
is diversifying individual risk using aggregate risk by adjusting the
preference parameter towards effort. Not surprisingly, expected utility also
increases in this case (it increases across all columns since ∂ v(.;θ )/∂θ
<0). The effects on asset returns remain negligible.
The last two columns, IV and V present the cases where δ increases in
the good aggregate state and bad aggregate state but not uniformly. In
column IV, δ(G)=5.0 and δ(B)=4.5; that is ∂ v(.;G)/∂ G<0 or v"(e(.);G)
increases by more than ∂ v(.;B)/∂ B<0 or v"(e(.);B). Again, we note that
the risk borne by the agent in terms of standard deviation of consumption
increases. The highlighted column V is where δ(G)=4.5 and δ(B)=5.0;
that is ∂ v(.;B)/∂ B<0 or v"(e(.);B) increases by more than ∂ v(.;G)/∂ G<0
or v"(e(.);G). It confirms the diversification result with the standard
deviation of consumption decreasing substantially. The risk-free return
increases in both cases but less that in the symmetric case and still by very
small amounts.
The striking result of Table 1 is that agents can indeed use aggregate
risk to diversify idiosyncratic risk thus affecting the main tool of the
principal to provide incentives. By having a preference behavior of
25

tolerating more effort when the aggregate state is bad and less effort when
the aggregate state is good, i.e. the variation in preference is negatively
correlated with the aggregate outcome, the agent can effectively diversify
idiosyncratic risk and increase expected utility under moral hazard.
Alternatively, by having a preference behavior of tolerating less effort
when the aggregate state is bad and more effort when the aggregate state is
good, i.e. the variation in preference is positively related to the aggregate
outcome, the agent looses the opportunity to further diversify idiosyncratic
risk and an endogenous mean-variance tradeoff emerges under moral
hazard.
Tables 2 and 3 present sensitivity analysis regarding risk aversion in
consumption and the parameter reflecting the (semi-) elasticity of the
probability function with respect to changes in effort. In Table 2, we
increase the consumption CRRA coefficient to ρ =3.0 and perform the
same experiment of Table 1. The pattern emerging across Table 1 is not
changed. Relative to Table 1, more consumption risk aversion magnifies
effort, consumption and variance of consumption relative effects. The
asset returns effect remains negligible. In Table 3, we increase the (semi-)
elasticity of the probability function with respect to effort to λ=0.4,
making the probability function more sensitive to effort. The pattern
emerging across Table 1 is not changed as well. Relative to Table 1, the
most notable effect is on the larger magnitude of the changes in the
probability function across columns. The asset return effect is relatively
larger, but still remains at below a quarter of a percent, thus negligible.
The conclusion from the general equilibrium quantitative assessment is
that variation in preference toward effort under moral hazard can be an
26

effective instrument to diversify idiosyncratic risk in the presence of
aggregate risk. However, while moral hazard per se does have an effect on
asset returns and the premium; actions of the agent using preference
towards effort to diversify idiosyncratic risk do not seem to have a
significant quantitative impact on the risk-free return and the risk
premium.
V. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we have examined the effects of variation in individual
preferences towards effort in the presence of aggregate and idiosyncratic
risk under moral hazard. Our results center around a fundamental
ambiguity in the preference towards effort in the presence of aggregate
risk. This fundamental ambiguity implies incompleteness in the standard
contract of the principal-agent relationship under moral hazard. We show
that this incompleteness can be conveniently explored by the agent,
effectively allowing for diversification of the idiosyncratic risk with
aggregate risk.
The main result is that by having a preference behavior consistent with
the variation in preference being negatively related to the aggregate
outcome, the agent can effectively diversify idiosyncratic risk and increase
expected utility under moral hazard. Alternatively, when the variation in
preference is positively related to the aggregate outcome, the agent looses
the opportunity to diversify idiosyncratic risk and an endogenous meanvariance tradeoff between expected utility and consumption risk emerges
under moral hazard. In all cases, the agent is better off in terms of
expected utility by setting preference towards effort that tolerates more
27

effort symmetrically across aggregate states. The key is that by
differentiating the preference behavior across aggregate states in a manner
that is negatively correlated with the aggregate state allows idiosyncratic
risk diversification.
However, we found that the quantitative effect of the variation in
preference towards effort on the risk-free return and the risk premium is
negligible and less than a quarter of a percent in the best case scenario.
Several avenues of future research are worth pursuing. First it is an
important issue to understand the way individuals form preferences toward
effort under aggregate risk and this seems to be an important avenue. The
most challenging seems to be an extension to the dynamic case where
principal and agent can interact and learn about each other actions
possibly converging to a scheme that can restore the principal's full ability
to induce effort, along the lines of Maskin and Tirole (1990), Hart and
Tirole (1988).
