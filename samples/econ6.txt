The Implications of Market Structure for Appliance
Energy Eﬃciency Regulation
By C. Anna Spurlock

∗

Draft: March 5, 2014

I derive and test predictions from the classic Mussa and Rosen
(1978) second-degree price discrimination model using data from
the United States clothes washer market. I ﬁnd evidence consistent with price discrimination in the market response to energy efﬁciency policy changes. Concurrent with the eﬀective dates of both
the new 2004 and 2007 federal minimum eﬃciency and ENERGY
STAR standards, within-model clothes washer prices dropped on
average. The heterogeneous pattern of price reduction across market segments, and adjustments in the menu of products, were consistent with predictions from the price-discrimination model, and
not with a perfectly competitive market.

The structure of the market for energy-consuming durables, such as appliances and automobiles, has important implications for energy eﬃciency regulation. These implications are explored in detail in this paper for the case of
the United States (US) clothes washer market. Firms with market power that
supply quality-diﬀerentiated goods have an incentive to under-supply quality relative to the social optimum - to those with the lowest willingness-to-pay for a
given quality characteristic in order to charge higher margins on products geared
towards consumers with a higher valuation of that quality characteristic. This
behavior is a form of second-degree price discrimination.
The classic model of a monopolist engaging in second-degree price discrimination in a quality-diﬀerentiated goods setting was articulated by Mussa and Rosen
(1978). Many researchers have since extended this original model (e.g., De Meza
and Ungern-Sternberg 1982; Katz 1984; Ronnen 1991; and Crampes and Hollander 1995). Most work to date addressing price discrimination in the context of
eﬃciency regulation in particular has focused largely on the automobile market,
and implications or repercussions of the corporate average fuel economy (CAFE)
standard. Some examples include the work of Fischer (2005 and 2010), primarily
focusing on a theoretical discussion of the comparative performance of various
environmental regulation mechanisms in an industry with consumer preference
heterogeneity for energy eﬃciency and ﬁrms with market power. In the area of
household appliances, the question of market structure was empirically addressed
by Ashenfelter, Hosken and Weinberg (2011). They demonstrated that the 2006
merger of Maytag and Whirlpool resulted in an increase in price and decrease
in product variety for some appliances, an outcome consistent with consolidating
market power. Additionally Houde (2012) demonstrated that the market response
to the 2008 change to the ENERGY STAR (ES) standard for refrigerators was
consistent with the Mussa and Rosen (1978) second-degree price discrimination
model.
In this paper I extend the previous work in this area; I empirically demonstrate

evidence consistent with price discrimination in the US clothes washer market
by documenting the market response to tightening the US federal minimum eﬃciency (ME) standard. The theoretical prediction when a stricter ME standard is
imposed in a market in which ﬁrms have been price discriminating with respect
to energy eﬃciency is a drop in prices faced by consumers in the short run. Some
evidence of an average drop in clothes washer prices was found by Chen, Dale
and Roberts (2013) at the time of the January 1st, 2007 restriction to the US
federal ME standard. In this paper I conﬁrm this result for the 2007 standard
change, as well as demonstrate that the average drop in prices was even more
pronounced at the time of the January 1st, 2004 restriction to the federal ME
standard. Additionally, I demonstrate that concurrent with the eﬀective dates of
both the 2004 and 2007 standard changes, the heterogeneous pattern of the drop
in prices across various eﬃciency-related market segments, as well as patterns of
change in the menu of products oﬀered, are consistent with those predicted by
the second-degree price discrimination model, and not readily consistent with a
perfectly competitive market.
In particular, I use a model based oﬀ of the Mussa and Rosen (1978) articulation of monopolistic second-degree price discrimination. I discuss the implication
of both a combined change in the ES and ME standards, and the oligopolistic
structure of the market, in the context of this model and its extensions in the
literature. I derive testable predictions regarding the price and menu adjustment
response to a combined change in the ME and ES standards. The predictions
diﬀerentiate between the case of a market in which ﬁrms can price discriminate
versus a perfectly competitive market. These testable predictions are: (i) The
imposition of a ME standard in a perfectly competitive market would predict an
increase in the price of products that are close substitutes to those eliminated
by the standard. On the other hand, in a market with imperfect competition in
which ﬁrms have been engaging in second-degree price discrimination, the imposition of a more stringent ME standard would impose downward pressure on prices

4

across the market, and in particular on mid- to low-end market segments; (ii) The
predicted eﬀect of a simultaneous change in both the ME and ES standards on the
price of products that remain ES certiﬁed across the standard change is ambiguous in the imperfectly competitive market. However, an observed drop in these
prices would be consistent with price discrimination and not perfect competition;
and ﬁnally (iii) in an oligopolistic market, the imposition of a ME standard could
stimulate expansion upward in the provision of eﬃciency in the market, and potentially increase product diversity on other dimensions besides eﬃciency as well.
This would not necessarily be the case in a perfectly competitive setting. I show
evidence consistent with an oligopolistic market structure for all three of these
points.
The implication for these results is that, in addition to negative environmental externalities, energy eﬃciency regulation directly addresses a second market
failure imposed by market power and the resulting under-provision of, and overcharging for, energy eﬃciency relative to the social optimum. Additionally, because of this market failure, the imposition of increasingly stringent regulation
does not necessarily result in the short-run trade-oﬀ of higher consumer prices
generally assumed in current federal ME standard regulatory impact analyses.
This point has important implications for projected welfare eﬀects of regulation,
both in terms of greater welfare gains, as well as a redistribution of the costs of
regulation away from consumers towards producers.
This paper will proceed as follows. Section I provides background on the history
of energy eﬃciency regulation at the federal level in the US; section II presents
the price-discrimination model and discusses the predictions for how the comparative static eﬀect on prices and product provision diﬀer between the competitive
and oligopolistic cases across the market; section III discusses the data; section IV demonstrates the empirical results of the average drop in prices in the
clothes washer market concurrent with the new standard eﬀective dates; section

I.

Policy Background

In 1975 the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) laid the initial groundwork at the national level for a variety of energy eﬃciency measures including test
procedures, labels and targets. EPCA was amended in 1979 to include energy efﬁciency standards to be established by the Department of Energy (DOE). In 1987
the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act (NAECA) established legislation stipulating that the minimum eﬃciency benchmark be periodically increased
for a variety of appliances sold in the US. Further legislation, including the Energy
Policy Act (EPAct) of 1992, as well as EPAct of 2005, and the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007 have continued to extend the number of
products subject to standards, as well as update standards, test procedures, and
review schedules.
Clothes washers were among the initial set of products for which ME standards
were established through NAECA; in 1987 Congress adopted the ﬁrst federal
standard for clothes washers to be eﬀective in 1988. DOE adopted the second
federal clothes washer standard in 1991, which went into eﬀect in 1994. This
analysis focuses on the third federal clothes washer standard, which was adopted
by DOE in 2001, and went into eﬀect in a two-tier process. The ﬁrst phase was
eﬀective on January 1st, 2004, and the second phase on January 1st, 2007. Also
in 2007, the fourth federal clothes washer standard was adopted by Congress, but
would not be eﬀective until 2011.
Clothes washers are also subject to the ES label. This is not a restrictive
standard, but rather establishes a benchmark of eﬃciency above which products
qualify for the ES label, signaling a model as highly eﬃcient to potential customers.
Table 1 provides a breakdown of the federal ME and ES standards for clothes

washers enacted between 1991 and 2007. Before 2004, the ME standard was based
on the Energy Factor (EF), which measures eﬃciency in terms of cubic feet per
kWh per cycle. In 2004 the criteria for meeting the ME standard became based
on the Modiﬁed Energy Factor (MEF). The MEF, also measured in cubic feet per
kWh per cycle, expanded upon the EF by incorporating the energy required to
dry moisture remaining in the clothing following the ﬁnal spin cycle. Similarly,
starting in 2001 the ES benchmark (only established for standard-size models)
was based oﬀ of the MEF. Beginning in 2007, the ES benchmark also became
contingent on the Water Factor (WF), which is the number of gallons per cycle
per cubic foot used by the washer.

Model

There is an extensive theoretical literature discussing price discrimination with
quality diﬀerentiation in imperfectly competitive markets. The classic case is
a monopoly engaging in second-degree price discrimination. This form of price
discrimination induces consumers to reveal otherwise unobservable information

about their preferences for a quality characteristic of a product by structuring
options and prices such that consumers sort themselves into purchasing the product that targets their willingness to pay for that characteristic. In this way the
monopolist can extract more consumer surplus than if they supplied only one
product type, or the socially optimal menu of products. Mussa and Rosen (1978)
provide the original model with a monopoly supplier and a continuous distribution
of consumer preferences for quality.
In section II.A I restate the basic model of a price discriminating monopolist,
and the predictions of how a ME standard change alone will aﬀect prices; in
section II.B I discuss the implication of the market being oligopolistic or monopolistically competitive, rather than monopolistic; in section II.C I discuss the
implication of the ME and ES standards changing simultaneously; and ﬁnally, in
section II.D I summarize the predictions of the model.

A.

Monopoly Price Discrimination and Minimum Eﬃciency Standard Change

I present here a simple reproduction, with N discrete types of consumers, of the
key aspects of the classic Mussa and Rosen (1978) monopoly price discrimination
model, pulling heavily from the characterization used by others (e.g., Donnenfeld
and White 1988; Ronnen 1991; Fischer 2005; Houde 2012).I then outline, following
Fischer (2005), the result of imposing a ME standard in this model.
Assume consumers have unit demand for a good, here an energy consuming
durable such as a clothes washer. Assume N types of consumers – low (type 1)
to high (type N ) – characterized by having diﬀerent levels of willingness to pay
for eﬃciency; assume θk is the valuation of consumer type k for eﬃciency where,
without loss of generality, θ1 < ... < θN . In equilibrium there will be N models
of clothes washers provided by the market, indexed by j, which vary in eﬃciency
(ej ) and price (pj ). Equation 1 shows the utility of consumer type k for model j.

Suppose there are M consumers and sk M have valuation θk , where

1. The monopolist does not observe a consumer’s type, so they cannot perfectly
price discriminate. Assume the cost of producing energy eﬃciency level ej is
c (ej ), and that c (ej ) ≥ 0, c￿ (ej ) ≥ 0 and c￿￿ (ej ) > 0.1 Note that I’m using k
to index consumer types and j to index model types. In equilibrium each model
type will correspond to one consumer type, so k and j will be equivalent. At this
point I make this explicit by indexing everything by j.
A social planner would choose the eﬃciency levels of their menu of products
to maximize total welfare. They would therefore solve the optimization problem
presented in equation 2.

The solution to the social planner’s problem is p∗ = c￿ e∗ = θj , ∀j ∈

eﬃciency for each model up until the point that the marginal cost of producing
that level of eﬃciency just equals the marginal consumer valuation. In a perfectly
competitive setting with free entry of new ﬁrms, price above marginal cost would
result in excess supply, so the socially optimal prices are also equal to marginal
cost.
Now I turn to the monopoly case. The monopolist picks the levels of eﬃciency
and price (ej , pj ) for each of the N models it supplies in order to extract the

maximum consumer surplus from all N types of consumers. If the monopolist
could perfectly price discriminate, they would have an incentive to provide the
social welfare maximizing level of eﬃciency, and would set price such that each
consumer would just be indiﬀerent between purchasing and not purchasing the
product. However, if the monopolist cannot ex ante identify a consumer’s type,
this outcome would not be an equilibrium.
In the case where the monopolist cannot identify which type of consumer is
which, they will engage in imperfect – or second-degree – price discrimination.
The monopolist chooses the eﬃciency levels and prices of the N types of models
they supply by maximizing their proﬁt subject to the IRj and ICjk constraints for
all j and k ￿= j types of consumers, where IRj refers to the Individual Rationality
(IR) constraint for the type j consumer, guaranteeing that all consumers will
participate in the market,2 and ICjk refers to the Incentive Compatibility (IC)
or self-selection constraint, assuring that consumer type j will be unwilling to
purchase product type k ￿= j in equilibrium. In a separating equilibrium (i.e.

pj ￿= pk and ej ￿= ek ∀j ￿= k), then θ1 < ... < θN implies that IR1 and ICjj−1 ∀j ∈
{2, ..., N } are binding while all other IR and IC constraints are non-binding.The
monopolist’s problem simpliﬁes to that shown in equation 3.

2 The monopolist may ﬁnd it more proﬁtable to only sell to a subset of consumer types, in which case
the IR constraint for all types would not hold. For the time being I assume away this case.

These results, as originally demonstrated by Mussa and Rosen (1978), indicate
that the second-degree price discriminating monopolist distorts downward the efﬁciency of all but the highest type products relative the social welfare maximizing
case. At the same time they charge more for a given level of eﬃciency compared
to the welfare maximizing case.3 In addition this price diﬀerential is higher for
higher levels of eﬃciency.
I now turn to a scenario in which a ME standard is imposed. This reproduces the same result as others who have discussed ME standards in a market
facing this type of price discrimination (e.g., Fischer 2005). Assume in this simple example that the ME standard requires that the monopolist only supply
products with eﬃciency level greater than or equal to the socially optimal eﬃciency level for the lowest type of consumer (i.e., the ME standard requires that
ej ≥ e∗ ∀j ∈ {1, ..., N }). Note that this is a binding constraint for the monopolist.

For simplicity I assume the standard is non-binding for all other eﬃciency levels.
The new monopoly solution of optimal price and eﬃciency levels given the
standard is presented in equation 5.

increase, it is oﬀset by the increase in their utility from improved eﬃciency, so
they are no worse oﬀ from a welfare perspective. Indeed, Ronnen (1991) states
that while the model predicts an increase in prices for this segment in nominal
terms, prices may actually drop in eﬃciency-adjusted terms. All customer types
above the lowest are made strictly better oﬀ, as they receive the same level of
eﬃciency as before, but at lower prices.
In the case of a perfectly competitive market on the other hand, the eﬃciencyprice schedule would already be socially optimal. Therefore, imposing a binding
standard would result in

ever, if the increase in price of the lowest eﬃciency group resulted in type-1 consumers substituting to higher eﬃciency levels, then this positive demand shock
would potentially increase prices in higher eﬃciency segments as well.
B.

Oligopoly Case

In the previous section I outlined the price eﬀect of the ME standard changing
in a monopolistic market. However, the clothes washer market in the US is
better described as oligopolistic or monopolistically competitive. The top four or
ﬁve manufacturers, including their brand subsidiaries, control between 93 and 98

12

MONTH YEAR

percent of the market.4 Whirlpool in particular controlled over 50 percent of the
market on average in the period of this analysis according to the data used in this
study.
There is a rich literature demonstrating that even when the monopoly assumption is relaxed to allow for duopoly, oligopoly, or monopolistic competition, the
unregulated case still results in an ineﬃcient range of quality, with a depression of
quality on the low-end below the socially optimal level, and prices still higher than
socially optimal. In particular Katz (1984) discusses a case with multiple ﬁrms
each selling a range of product quality, and with market power due to brand
loyalty. This brand loyalty is modeled as a premium incurred by consumers if
they have to switch from their preferred brand. A key assumption is that consumers who are more quality-conscious are also more brand-conscious. In this
setting, there are higher margins on the high-end segments of the market, and
more competition in the low-end of the market. This means sales of high-end
products are more proﬁtable, and it is therefore more important to capture and
maintain the loyalty of those consumers on the high-end relative to the low-end.
For this reason, quality on the low-end is depressed downwards to prevent high
types from switching down. Therefore, quality is depressed on the low-end in the
non-monopoly imperfect competition case, and price margins still increase with
quality. Indeed De Meza and Ungern-Sternberg (1982) demonstrate it can even
be the case that a monopolistically competitive market result in an even wider
range of quality and even higher prices than in the monopoly case.
Some more recent theoretical literature has returned to the price discrimination
model and found some more ambiguous results when the market is oligopolistic
(e.g., Armstrong and Vickers 2001; Rochet and Stole 2002; Fischer 2010). However, while there are some cases in which the equilibrium outcome is such that
quality is not depressed on the low end, or price is not elevated on the high end, of
4 The top manufacturers of clothes washers are Whirlpool, General Electric, Maytag (before their
merger with Whirlpool in 2006), Electrolux, and LG Electronics.

13

an unregulated oligopolistic market, these equilibria are not always unique (Armstrong and Vickers 2001), and are highly sensitive to the assumption that brand
and quality preferences are uncorrelated (Armstrong and Vickers 2001; Rochet
and Stole 2002). This is an empirical question, but the results when brand preference and quality are correlated do tend to be more consistent, and anecdotal
evidence from informal discussions with people involved in the industry corroborates this description of the market. So, for now, I choose to defer to the earlier
theoretical literature by Katz (1984) and others.
Others have demonstrated the theoretical impact of minimum quality standards on quality-diﬀerentiated markets that are oligopolistic or monopolistically
competitive. In particular Ronnen (1991) develops a model of an industry in
which multiple ﬁrms face quality-dependent ﬁxed costs and compete in quality
and prices. In this model, the introduction of a minimum quality standard causes
high quality sellers to increase quality to alleviate price competition induced by
the collapsing of the quality range on the low end. However, the assumption that
c￿￿ (e) > 0 assures high quality producers raise quality less than the increase in
quality on the low end induced by the minimum quality standard. This means
price competition is intensiﬁed regardless of attempts by high-end ﬁrms to alleviate it, so in the end, prices (controlling for quality level) still drop. Crampes
and Hollander (1995) extend the model developed by Ronnen (1991) by allowing
the quality costs to be variable instead of ﬁxed. They ﬁnd the same qualitative
results as did Ronnen, but while Ronnen showed that consumers necessarily gain
from a minimum quality standard, Crampes and Hollander show that consumer
welfare increases only if the high quality ﬁrm does not respond by raising quality
too drastically.
Therefore, predictions for an oligopolistic or monopolistically competitive market are qualitatively consistent with the monopoly case, contingent on the assumption that consumers who care more about quality are also more likely to be
brand-conscious. This implies that the monopoly model is a reasonable proxy for

14

MONTH YEAR

the non-monopoly imperfect competition setting.
In addition to the consistency of the price predictions between the monopolistic and oligopolistic models, the literature on oligopolistic price discrimination
discusses an additional implication of imposing a minimum quality standard in
such a setting. Ronnen (1991) and Crampes and Hollander (1995) derive that
following a new minimum quality standard, imperfectly competitive producers
have an incentive to expand quality upwards to increase the spread of quality
in the market again following the new standard. They do this to alleviate the
increased price competition between products imposed by the quality distribution
collapse following the new standard. Realistically speaking, there is more than
one quality dimension for products supplied in these markets, so I would suggest
that this process by which ﬁrms attempt to reduce competition may be multifaceted; they may indeed expand the collapsed quality dimension upward (in this
case increase the eﬃciency of products at the high end of the market following a
ME standard restriction), but increased product diﬀerentiation could take place
on other dimensions as well. Therefore, increased product diversity in general
many be indicative of this process.
C.

ENERGY STAR Standard Change

Here I discuss the implications of a change in the ES standard in the model with
quality diﬀerentiated products. Houde (2012) explores the result of an isolated
increase in the ES standard for refrigerators in 2008, in which case a change in the
ES standard has distinct price predictions. In the setting when the ME standard
is changing simultaneously, the ES standard changing primarily serves to muddle
the predictions on the price for higher eﬃciency market segments.
Pulling somewhat from Houde (2012), you can see this by assuming consumers
do not pay perfect attention to the eﬃciency level of the products they consider
purchasing, and so ej represents a composite of eﬃciency-relevant signals picked
up by the consumer. One may be the true energy eﬃciency of the product, while

VOL. VOLUME NO. ISSUE

15

another may be the ES status of the product, etc.
Products decertiﬁed from ES as a result of the ES standard change may be
perceived as less energy eﬃcient once they no longer have the ES label, even if the
actual energy eﬃciency levels of the products have not changed. A decertiﬁcation
from ES might result in a negative demand shock, resulting in a drop in the
price of these products. This would be true regardless of market structure, and
so does not serve as a basis to empirically diﬀerentiate between competitive and
price-discriminating markets.
For products that were ES certiﬁed both before and after the new standard, the
model provides ambiguous price predictions. The prices of products that qualiﬁed
for ES both before and after the new standard are not predicted to change in a
perfectly competitive market. In the imperfectly competitive model however, the
fact that consumers may perceive products that are decertiﬁed from ES as less energy eﬃcient than before could allow producers to increase the prices of products
that remain ES compliant, this is because

∂pj
∂ej−1

< 0 in the monopolistic price-

discrimination model. However, the ME standard is putting downward pressure
on the prices of these products as well, rendering the price prediction ambiguous.
However, a drop in the price of products that remain ES compliant both before
and after the standard is consistent with imperfect competition, though not with
perfect competition.
D.

Summary of Model Predictions

In summary, there are three primary predictions of the eﬀect of a new ME
standard in the imperfectly competitive model that are in contrast to the predictions implied by a perfectly competitive model: (i) The imposition of a ME
standard in a perfectly competitive market would predict an increase in the price
of products in the market, particularly those that are close substitutes to products eliminated by the standard. On the other hand, in a market with imperfect
competition in which ﬁrms have been engaging in second-degree price discrimina-

tion, the imposition of a more stringent ME standard would result in downward
pressure on prices across the market, and in particular on mid- to low-end market
segments; (ii) The predicted eﬀect of a simultaneous change in both the ME and
ES standards on the price of products that remain ES certiﬁed is ambiguous in
the imperfectly competitive market. However, an observed drop in these prices
would be consistent with price discrimination and not perfect competition; and
ﬁnally (iii) in an oligopolistic market, the imposition of a ME standard could
stimulate expansion upward in the levels of eﬃciency supplied to the market, and
potentially increase product diversity on other dimensions as well. This would
not necessarily be the case in a perfectly competitive setting.

Data

I use point-of-sale data for clothes washers, dryers and room air conditioners
(RACs) from NPD Group.5 These data are acquired from an incomplete set of
retailers in the US.6 The data are aggregated to the national level and consist of
monthly total revenue and total quantity sold observations by individual model
number.
The NPD data for clothes washers were matched to energy usage data by model
number and year from three sources: (1) the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
appliance energy database, (2) the ENERGY STAR database, and (3) the California Energy Commission (CEC) appliance energy database. The FTC data
provide a measure of kilowatt-hours per year (kWh/year) energy usage, which
corresponds to the Energy Guide label posted on products at the point of sale.
Both the ENERGY STAR and CEC sources provide data on the EF, MEF and
WF of products.7 However, these latter sources cover a much smaller subset of
the model numbers in the NPD data. The way in which I use these three energy
use data sources is explained in more detail below.
5 NPD is not an acronym, but rather the name of the company: The NPD Group, Inc., The NPD
Group/NPD Houseworld. Port Washington, NY.
6 A list of participating retailers can be found in Appendix A.

In order to control for changes in macroeconomic shocks to the appliance market, and to control for changes to the retailer mix in the NPD data over time, I use
both dryers and RACs as counterfactual groups.8 Neither dryers nor RACs had
any energy-eﬃciency policy changes during the study period. However, both of
these appliances are imperfect counterfactuals in some ways. First, RACs, while
arguably a relatively independent product from clothes washers, did experience
more general price volatility and were more prone to seasonal price variability
compared to clothes washers. Second, dryers and washers are likely compliments,
so their prices and sales should be positively correlated. Therefore the price effects of policies imposed on clothes washers measured relative to dryers will likely
be underestimates.
The NPD data, while extensive in some ways, are imperfect in others. In
particular, 40 percent of the observations had model numbers that were masked
to ensure anonymity of the retailers. These observations therefore could not be
matched to any of the energy usage data, and so had to be omitted from the
analysis. Of the models that do have fully detailed model numbers, 12 percent
of the observations were for model numbers not included in the FTC energy
usage database, and therefore had to be omitted as well. In order to maintain
comparability between clothes washers and the counterfactual appliance groups,
masked model numbers were also dropped from the dryer and RAC data.
As mentioned in Section I, the energy measures used to determine the compliance of washer models with ME and ES standards in 2004 and 2007 are the MEF
and WF. These eﬃciency measures are not available for many of the models in
the NPD data during this period. The ENERGY STAR and CEC data do provide these measures for a subset of models, speciﬁcally those that were at some
point labeled as ES, or were sold in California. This means the MEF and WF
data are only available for relatively high-eﬃciency models, and so cannot reli8 Some retailers did enter or exit the data at diﬀerent times in the series, however I was assured by
NPD that the large retailers do not change over the study period.

ably be used to identify models that are made non-compliant with the new ME
standards. However, they can more dependably identify whether or not models
are ES qualiﬁed at various points in time. All models that could not be matched
to the CEC or ENERGY STAR data are assumed to have never been ES qualiﬁed
within the study period.
While the FTC kWh/year measure does not correspond directly to the MEF or
WF used to set the standards, it is an important indicator of energy consumption,
particularly from the perspective of the consumer purchase decision, as it is posted
on products at the retail outlet to inform consumers about the energy use of their
potential purchases. I use the FTC energy use measure to identify models that
are likely to have been eliminated by the new ME standards. This categorization
is not exact, but provides a roughly intuitive way of stratifying the market to
explore heterogeneous price eﬀects of changes in the standards. This process will
be described in more detail in section V.
There are 594 unique clothes washer models, 820 unique dryer models, and
595 unique RAC models used in the analysis, summary statistics for which are
provided in table 2. An individual appliance model number uniquely identiﬁes a
particular design. Therefore, controlling for model-speciﬁc ﬁxed eﬀects will likely
control for more or less all relevant unobserved characteristics of the models from
a consumer perspective. If a major characteristic changes, then this is likely to
result in a new unique model number.
Looking more closely at the summary statistics in table 2, recall that the
changes to clothes washer standards occurred on January 1st, 2004, and January
1st, 2007. The real prices of clothes washers and dryers have risen on average
between 2003 and 2007: approximately 5.3 percent for clothes washers and 26.8
percent for dryers. On the other hand, the average real prices of RACs went down
slightly (approximately 6.5 percent) over this time period. The FTC kWh/year
energy use of clothes washers has signiﬁcantly decreased over this period, with
a 56.3 percent reduction between 2003 and 2007. Additionally, the prevalence

Note: This table shows annual averages (and standard deviations) of prices and energy consumption, as

(FL); the share of FL models that are ES qualiﬁed; and the share of top load (TL) models that are ES

of front-loading washer models has steadily increased over time, making up 18
percent of observations in 2003 and increasing to 46 percent in 2007. Finally,
while the prevalence of ES qualiﬁcation has increased for both front- and top-load
machines over this time period,9 it has generally been the case that front-load
washers are much more likely to be ES qualiﬁed than top-load washers.
Figure 1 shows the price trends – both on average and within-model – of the
three appliances used in this analysis between 2002 and 2009, normalized to average prices in January 2002. Of particular interest in this ﬁgure is that the
within-model prices drop steadily over this time period for all three appliances,

therefore the low rates of qualiﬁcation, particularly in 2003, may be an artifact of the data.

Results: Average Price Eﬀects

In this section I estimate the market-average short-run price eﬀect at the time
of the combined ME and ES standard changes for clothes washers. I limit all

MARKET STRUCTURE AND EFFICIENCY REGULATION

21

of the analysis in the remainder of the paper to one year prior to the standard
change and one year after.10
In order to quantify the eﬀects shown graphically in ﬁgure 1, I use two estimation strategies. First, I model time as ﬂexibly as possible by including dummy
variables for each appliance-time-period (equation 6), and second I impose a linear time-trend assumption on prices (equation 7). In the former case, time is
accounted for extremely ﬂexibly, and no structure is imposed on the prices over
time, however the price eﬀect of the standard is primarily estimated oﬀ of the
diﬀerences between prices in the month just prior to and the month in which
the new standard became eﬀective, and so is sensitive to any anomalous shocks
in these two months. In the latter case, I allow the linear trend to diﬀer across
appliances and to change at the standard eﬀective date. Even given this, the
assumption of a linear price trend is relatively restrictive. However, it does allow
an estimation of the eﬀect of the standard on the rate of change of prices over
time, as well as on the level change.
The ﬁrst estimation strategy is presented in equation 6. In this equation pit is
deﬂated price at time t of model i. The variable Ti is a dummy variable equal
to one if the observation is for an appliance aﬀected by the standard (clothes
washers) and equal to zero otherwise (dryers or RACs). The term Standardt is
a dummy variable that turns on at the time the new standard takes eﬀect. The
term τt represents a set of dummy variables for each time-period in the sample
(with the month prior to, and the month of the standard change omitted). I run
the regressions with and without ﬁxed eﬀects and with and without each of the
counterfactual appliances. In the regressions with ﬁxed eﬀects the term µTi is
omitted; in the regressions without ﬁxed eﬀects γi is omitted; and for regressions

10 I limit the analysis to one year both before and after the policy change in order to isolate the analysis
from other policy changes, and because the short-run is the most relevant lens for testing the imperfect
competition price-discrimination model predictions presented in section II.

with no counterfactual group β2 = µ = 0.
(6)

pit =α + µTi + β2 Standardt + δTi · Standardt + τt + τt · Ti + γi + εit

The second estimation strategy is presented in equation 7. In this equation
pit , Ti and Standardt are deﬁned as above. Additionally, the term T rendt is a
linear time trend. In the regressions with ﬁxed eﬀects the term µTi is omitted;
in the regressions without ﬁxed eﬀects γi is omitted; and for regressions with no
counterfactual group β1 = β2 = β3 = µ = 0.

The coeﬃcients of interest are the coeﬃcients on Ti · Standardt · T rendt and
Ti ·Standardt . The coeﬃcient on Ti ·Standardt is interpreted as the discontinuous
level change, in dollars, of the price at the eﬀective date of the new standard,
and the coeﬃcient on Ti · Standardt · T rendt is interpreted as the change in the
average incremental amount, in dollars, by which prices rise or fall each month
following the standard relative to before the standard. In the regressions with a
counterfactual, the eﬀects are interpreted relative to the counterfactual.
Panel A of table 3 shows the results without ﬁxed eﬀects using the ﬁrst estimation strategy with appliance-speciﬁc time eﬀects, while panels B and C show
the results with ﬁxed eﬀects using the ﬁrst and second estimation strategies, respectively. In all cases I present three sets of regression results. Columns 1 and 4
present the results including CW alone; columns 2 and 5 present the results of the
diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences (DD) regressions including dryers as the counterfactual,
and ﬁnally columns 3 and 6 present the results of the DD regressions including

RACs as the counterfactual. Columns 1 trough 3, and 4 through 6, show the
results from the 2004 and 2007 standard changes, respectively.
The average market price results in panel A of table 3 indicate that there is no
consistent evidence of a statistically signiﬁcant change in average market prices at
the time the 2004 standard came into eﬀect for clothes washers.11 In 2007 there
is some evidence that average prices dropped for clothes washers by around $44
concurrent with the standard change. If the change in standard only resulted in
relatively inexpensive low-eﬃciency models being eliminated, the average market
price would increase. These results point to the presence of some other price
adjustment.
Panels B and C of table 3 demonstrate that within-model prices discontinuously
dropped signiﬁcantly by between $34 and $72 in 2004 and $15 and $32 in 2007
on average, depending on the speciﬁcation. Additionally, in panel C there is
evidence that prices began trending downward more quickly after the standard
changes relative to before. The magnitude of this incremental increase in the rate
of change of the downward trend in within-model prices was around $3 per month
after the 2004 standard change and between $4 and $7 per month following the
2007 standard change.
As can be seen in ﬁgure 1, the prices of RACs (both on average and withinmodel) are more volatile and seasonally cyclical compared to the other two products. It is for this reason that the results presented in panels B and C of table
3 relative to RACs vary the most. I am more inclined to favor the estimation
strategy using the linear time trend for the case of RACs as the counterfactual,
as this speciﬁcation is less sensitive to a random one-month shift in RAC prices.
In sum, the eﬀect on average market prices was somewhat inconsistent, but
there is some evidence that prices dropped on average at the time of the 2007 standard change. Within-model prices consistently demonstrated evidence of both a
11 The average price of RACs dropped in January 2004, but jumped quickly back up again, so the large
signiﬁcant estimate on T · Standard in column 3 of panel A in table 3 is based on a one-month drop in
the RAC prices that did not persist.

signiﬁcant drop in level, and increased downward trend at both standard changes.
V.

Results: Market-Segment Heterogeneity

The previous section demonstrated that there was a clear drop in the withinmodel price on average, both in the form of a level drop and a increasingly rapid
downward trend, at the time of both the 2004 and 2007 standard changes. Why
might this price drop have occurred? To answer this question, I present empirical
tests of the price discrimination model predictions presented in section II.
The initial step in this process is to characterize relevant market segments.
As I will demonstrate, the clothes washer market is made up of three primary
market strata: front-load washers are the most eﬃcient, followed by mid- to higheﬃciency top-load washers, and ﬁnally low-eﬃciency top-load washers make up
the bottom of the market.
Figure 2 shows the distribution of kWh/year observations for clothes washers
in the the year just prior to and the year just following the two standard changes
examined here. The distributions of front-load and top-load washers are shown
separately. I identify cut-oﬀs for top-load models based on these distributions.
These cut-oﬀs are 700 and 520 kWh/year in 2004 and 2007, respectively. They
are indicated by the vertical lines in the bottom two panels of ﬁgure 2. I posit
that the new standard is most likely to be binding for those models above the
cut-oﬀ. There are two additional observations of note in ﬁgure 2. First, front-load
washers are signiﬁcantly more eﬃcient than top-load washers in general. Second,
the 2004 standard change resulted in a relatively large shift in the energy use
distribution for top-load washers. In contrast, the incremental shift following the
2007 standard change was less extreme.
Categorizing products based on observable energy-eﬃciency characteristics results in nine categories: (1) front-load models that span the standard change
(FL); (2) front-load models that exit the market prior to the standard change
(FL Exit); (3) front-load models that enter the market following the standard

are more likely to have been eliminated by the standard change.

exit the market prior to the standard change (TL Exit); and ﬁnally, (9) top-load
models that enter the market following the standard change (TL Enter).
Table 4 provides summary information for each of these nine groups. Two key
observations from this table are: (i) Most, though not all, products in the TL
Low EE group are eliminated by the standard. Particularly in 2004 close to 15
percent of the TL Low EE models were still in the market a full year after the
standard was changed; and (ii) while almost all front-load models that enter the
market just following either standard change are ES qualiﬁed, only 16 percent in
2004 and 12 percent in 2007 of the many top-load models that enter the market
following the standard change are ES qualiﬁed. This is indicative of a pattern I
will elucidate further bellow, that new top-load models are introduced to maintain
the low-end of the market, while new front-load models are introduced to spread
the high-end of the market upward.
Figure 3 shows the trends in (i) average real price; (ii) average within-model
eﬃciency-adjusted price; and (iii) annual energy consumption, of the nine groups
deﬁned in table 4. From this set of graphs the market categorizations are further
clariﬁed. The front-load models make up the top of the market both in terms of
energy consumption (lowest) and price (highest). The mid-range top-load models
are mid-range both in terms of price and energy consumption, and the low-end

Note: This table characterizes the nine categories of products I deﬁne: front-load models that span the
standard change (FL); front-load models that exit (enter) the market prior to (following) the standard
change (FL Exit/Enter); top-load models that remain in the market and ES qualiﬁed across the standard
change (TL ES); top-load models that were ES qualiﬁed and remain in the market across the standard
change, but become decertiﬁed from ES qualiﬁcation as a result of the standard change (TL Decert.);
relatively high-eﬃciency non-ES top-load models that span the standard change and are not likely to have
been directly eliminated by the standard (TL High EE); relatively low-eﬃciency non-ES top-load models
that span the standard change and are more likely to have been directly eliminated by the standard
(TL Low EE); and ﬁnally, top-load models that exit (enter) the market prior to (following) the standard
change (TL Exit/Enter). While the table indicates that there were no TL models that remained ES
qualiﬁed and in the market across the 2004 standard change, in actuality in the data there was one
model that was in this category. However, given that the variable is only a proxy for ES certiﬁcation,
only one model in that category is within the margin of error for that category deﬁnition. I chose to
include this one model in the TL High EE group in 2004 instead. The numbers in parentheses are
standard errors of the mean price and kWh/year measures.

MONTH YEAR

Focusing on the annual energy consumption graphs in the bottom two panels of
ﬁgure 3, it is clear that the 2004 standard precipitated a notable drop in annual
energy consumption of available models at the bottom of the market. Existing
TL Low EE models increased in eﬃciency, and models introduced following the
standard change were signiﬁcantly more eﬃcient than those dropping out of the
market the year before. The change in annual energy consumption at the 2007
standard eﬀective date was less extreme, coming primarily in the form of ineﬃcient
models dropping out of the market leading up to January 1st, 2007. Looking
broadly at the price changes around the standard eﬀective dates, of note is that
while there is some reorganization leading up to the standard, the imposition
of the new standard is followed by a clear re-establishment of market ranking.
Additionally, new front-load models ﬁll out the new high end, while new top-load
models ﬁll out the new low end, both in terms of price and energy consumption.
The magnitude and signiﬁcance of these particular price patterns will be discussed
in more detail below.
Figure 4 provides a visual description of eﬀects on the menu of products available in the market following the policy changes. In particular, consistent with the
third prediction of the oligopolistic price discrimination model, the new standards
resulted in an increase in the variety of front-load models oﬀered in the market
(shown in the bottom two panels). Interestingly, it is clear that this was not at
the expense of model variety - at least in terms of number of models available and
purchased - of top-load models (shown in the top two panels). Indeed, the overall number of both front- and top-load models expanded around each standard
change. New top-load models tended to replace the lowest eﬃciency products in
both cases. This is evident when looking at the average kWh/year and average
price levels for each of the groups in the year preceding and the year following
each standard change shown in table 4; new top-load models entering after each
standard change are of a similar eﬃciency and price-point as the TL High EE
group now making up the low-end of the market, while new front-load models

entering after each standard change are of a similar eﬃciency (and even higher
price-point) compared to the existing front-load models in the market.

Note: This ﬁgure shows the number of individual models available in each of the nine market segments
deﬁned in table 4, as well as overall, in each month surrounding both the 2004 (left-hand panels) and
2007 (right-hand panels) standard changes.

Returning to the question of the price eﬀects within each of the deﬁned market
segments, I run a series of regressions to quantify the price eﬀects separately for
each of these groups. Once again, I use both an estimation strategy that ﬂexibly
controls for time eﬀects (equation 8), and a strategy that assumes a linear time
trend allowed to change at the standard date (equation 9). In these estimating
equations pit,j , Standardt , T rendt , τt and γi are all deﬁned as in equations 7
and 6. Now however, the j subscript is an index over the set of seven market
segments deﬁned in table 4 (where models that enter following, or exit prior to,

32

MONTH YEAR

the standard are grouped together for front- and top-load models separately). In
the regressions without ﬁxed eﬀects γi is omitted. Note that for the two groups
“FL Exit/Enter” and “TL Exit/Enter,” the individual models do not span the
standard change date, so the term Standardt is omitted for these two groups
in the ﬁxed-eﬀect regressions. Additionally, there are no models in the market
segments “TL ES” or “TL ES Decert” during the 2004 standard change. Finally,
the term kW hit,j , which is the FTC annual energy use measure, is included as
well in order to capture the eﬃciency-adjusted change in price.

(8)

pit,j =αj + δj Standardt + νj kW hit,j + τt + γi + εit,j

(9)

pit,j =αj + ψj T rendt + δj Standardt + φj Standardt · T rendt
+ νj kW hit,j + γi + εit,j

The results for each market segment are shown in tables 5, 6 and 7. In all cases
columns 1, 2, 5 and 6 show the results using the estimation strategy shown in
equation 8, while columns 3, 4, 7, and 8 show the results using the linear time
assumption shown in equation 9. Columns 1 through 4 show results for the 2004
standard change, while columns 5 through 8 show results for the 2007 standard
change. Columns 1, 3, 5, and 7 omit ﬁxed-eﬀects, but show the eﬃciency-adjusted
average price change by including kW hit,j . Finally, columns 2, 4, 6, and 8 control
for both model-speciﬁc ﬁxed eﬀects and kW hit,j . The favored speciﬁcations are
the those that include model-speciﬁc ﬁxed eﬀects.
The results for the front-load categories, making up the top of the market, can
be seen in table 5. Panel A of table 5 shows the results for front-load models that
span the standard change (FL), while panel B shows the results for the models
that exited prior to or entered following the standard change (FL Exit/Enter).
The only clear pattern emerging from the front-load models is that within-model
prices, particularly following the 2007 standard change, for both pre existing and

VOL. VOLUME NO. ISSUE

MARKET STRUCTURE AND EFFICIENCY REGULATION

33

new models, began trending downward more quickly following the standard eﬀective date relative to before. This pattern was also true for new front-load models
following the 2004 standard change, though not for the models spanning the standard change in 2004. While the instantaneous price eﬀect tended to be negative
across the board for pre existing front-load models, the eﬀect is only statistically
signiﬁcant in a couple of cases. Front-load models introduced following the standard tended to be more expensive on average than those dropped prior to the
standard change, though the diﬀerence is never statistically signiﬁcant.
The results for the middle of the market are shown in table 6. Panel A of table
6 shows the results for top-load models that were ES certiﬁed both before and
after the standard change (TL ES); panel B shows the results for top-load models
that were decertiﬁed from ES as a result of the standard change (TL Decert.);
and panel C shows the results for top-load models that were not ES qualiﬁed,
but were not likely to have been eliminated directly be the new standard (TL
High EE). The middle of the market is made up of only the TL High EE group
in 2004, which experienced within-model drops in price of $69, signiﬁcant at a 10
percent conﬁdence level, shown in columns 2 and 4 of panel C in table 6. At the
time of the 2007 standard change, the middle of the market is also made up of ES
qualifying top-load models, and those decertiﬁed from ES by the 2007 standard.
Decertiﬁed models experienced consistent and signiﬁcant drops in price of around
$42 within-model, shown in columns 6 and 8 of panel B in table 6. This is
consistent with the fact that these products have presumably lost a quality signal
they previously had. Products that maintained their ES label across the standard
change experienced a large signiﬁcant drop in price of around $110 within-model,
shown in column 6 of panel A in table 6. This eﬀect is signiﬁcant even given that
there were only ten models in this category, though only in the speciﬁcation using
time ﬁxed eﬀects and not the linear trend assumption. This makes sense, given
that there is a clearly nonlinear price pattern for this group prior to the standard
change evident in center-right panel of ﬁgure 3. This implies that the imposition

of the linear time trend is too restrictive in the TL ES case. Therefore, columns
5 and 6 are the favored speciﬁcations for panel A of table 6.
Finally, price eﬀects for the bottom of the market are shown in table 7. Panel A
of table 7 shows the results for ineﬃcient top-load models that span the standard
change, but were likely to be eliminated by the new standard (TL Low EE), while
panel B shows the results for the top-load models that exited prior to or entered
following the standard change (TL Exit/Enter). Within-model prices of the TL
Low EE group dropped signiﬁcantly at the time of the 2004 standard change by
between $49 and $58, shown in columns 2 and 4 of panel A in table 7. This may
be due in part to discounting obsolete models that no longer meet the standard.
The price drop of the TL Low EE group was less consistently signiﬁcant following
the 2007 standard change, though there is some evidence that not only did withinmode prices drop by around $20, but they began trending downward around $6
per month more quickly following the 2007 standard change relative to before,
shown in columns 7 and 8 of panel A in table 7. New top-load models were
signiﬁcantly less expensive in eﬃciency-adjusted terms than those dropped at the
time of the new standard by over $200, though this diﬀerence is only signiﬁcant
following the 2004 standard eﬀective date, shown in panel B of table 7.
Taking ﬁgures 3 and 4, and tables 5, 6 and 7 as a whole, a clear pattern begins
to emerge. As the new ME and ES standard becomes more restrictive, the price
of models at the low end and mid-low end of the market dropped discontinuously
in eﬃciency-adjusted terms. This was seen for the TL Low EE groups both in
2004 and 2007, the TL High EE group in 2004 and the TL ES group in 2007.
Models decertiﬁed from ES dropped in price as well, though there are not many
of them, and over half exited the market within a year of the standard. New
top-load models entering the market tended to replace the low end of the market.
While they met the new standard, the majority were not ES qualiﬁed, and tended
to replace relatively inexpensive, ineﬃcient models, although there was a modest
high-end top-load segment maintained. The new top-load models introduced

Note: This table shows the regression results for the bottom of the market product categories. The
dependent variable in all cases is price deﬂated using the consumer price index to December 2009 prices.
The term “Standard” is a dummy variable equal to zero prior to the standard eﬀective date, and equal to
one starting on the standard eﬀective date. The term “Trend” is a linear time trend. Columns 1 through
4 show results for the 2004 standard change, while columns 5 through 8 show results for the 2007 standard
change. Columns 1, 3, 5 and 7 include no ﬁxed eﬀects, but show the eﬃciency-adjusted average price
change by including kW hit ; ﬁnally, columns 2, 4, 6 and 8 control for both model-speciﬁc ﬁxed eﬀects
and kW hit . Standard errors clustered at the model-number level are shown in the parentheses.

after the 2004 standard also tended to experience a signiﬁcant large-magnitude
price drop, in eﬃciency-adjusted terms, compared to those they replace, and their
prices tended to trend downward more quickly following the standard relative to
the price trend of those models that exited the market prior to the standard.
These eﬀects are of similar magnitude concurrent with the 2007 standard, though
not statistically signiﬁcant. At the high end of the market, new front-load models
appear to be designed to expand eﬃciency available in the market upward, in
that close to 100 percent of front-load models introduced following the standard
changes were ES qualiﬁed. They did tend to be more expensive on average than
those they replaced, though not statistically signiﬁcantly so. However, the prices
of new front-load models dropped more quickly over time than the prices of those
they replaced. Additionally, there is some evidence that the within-model prices
of front-load models that remained in the market across the standard trended
downward more quickly following the standard relative to before, particularly in
2007.

Conclusion

In this paper I corroborate evidence found by Chen, Dale and Roberts (2013)
that prices of clothes washers dropped on average at the time the ME and ES standard restrictions came into eﬀect in 2007, and showed that this pattern was even
more pronounced at the time these standards were restricted in 2004. I outline
the classic Mussa and Rosen (1978) model of second-degree price discrimination,
and extend previous discussions of the predictions in this model of imposing a
more restrictive ME standard by discussing the implications of simultaneously
changing the ES labeling standard as well. Using this model, I derive three primary predictions of the eﬀect of a more restrictive ME and ES standard in the
imperfectly competitive model that are in contrast to the predictions implied by
a perfectly competitive model: First, (i) the imposition of a ME standard in a
perfectly competitive market would predict an increase in the price of products

in the market, particularly low-end products that are close substitutes to products eliminated by the standard. On the other hand, in a market in which ﬁrms
have been engaging in second-degree price discrimination, the imposition of a
more stringent ME standard would impose downward pressure on prices across
the market, particularly at the mid- to low-end. Second, (ii) the predicted effect of a simultaneous change in both the ME and ES standards on the price of
products that remain ES certiﬁed, or are front-load models, is ambiguous in the
imperfectly competitive market. However, an observed drop in these prices would
be consistent with price discrimination. Finally, (iii) in an oligopolistic market,
the imposition of a ME standard could stimulate expansion upward in the levels
of eﬃciency supplied to the market, and potentially increase the general diversity
of products available in the market in other dimensions as well. This would not
necessarily be the case in a perfectly competitive setting.
I have shown evidence consistent with price discrimination on all three of these
points. The results from testing the ﬁrst two predictions are summarized in ﬁgure
5. With regard to point (i), I have shown that as the new ME and ES standards
became more restrictive, the price of models at the low-end and mid-low end of
the market (the TL Low EE groups both in 2004 and 2007 and the TL High EE
group in 2004) dropped discontinuously, particularly in eﬃciency-adjusted terms.
Additionally, new top-load models entering the market replaced the low end of
the market, were not in large part ES qualiﬁed, and tended to be signiﬁcantly
less expensive, in eﬃciency-adjusted terms, compared to those they replaced,
particularly following the 2004 standard. With regard to the second point (ii),
the TL ES group experienced a statistically signiﬁcant price drop at the time of
the 2007 standard change. Finally, with regard to point (iii), at the high end of
the market new front-load models extended eﬃciency of products available in the
market upward; close to 100 percent of front-load models introduced following the
standard changes were ES qualiﬁed, compared to only around 15 percent of new
top-load models. Additionally, the overall number of individual models available

in the market increased. This was especially true for front-load models, but was
true for top-load models as well.

Note: This ﬁgure depicts the point-estimates of the T · Standard coeﬃcients from the ﬁxed-eﬀect regression results (columns 2 and 4 for 2004, and 6 and 8 for 2007, in order left to right) of the eﬀect of
the 2004 and 2007 standard changes on prices from tables 5, 6 and 7. The solid bars represent point
estimates that were signiﬁcant at the 90% conﬁdence level or higher, while the outlined bars represent
point estimates that were not statistically signiﬁcant. The rows of arrows at the top depict the model
predictions for the price eﬀects in each of these market segments in the case of either perfect competition,
or second-degree price discrimination.

This paper demonstrates evidence consistent with price discrimination in the US
clothes washer market: concurrent with the eﬀective dates of both the 2004 and
2007 standard changes, the pattern of the drop in prices across various eﬃciencyrelated market segments, as well as patterns of change in the menu of products
oﬀered, are consistent with those predicted by the second-degree price discrimination model, and not readily consistent with a perfectly competitive market. The
implication for these results is that, in addition to negative environmental externalities, energy eﬃciency regulation directly addresses an additional market failure – namely, market power and the resulting under-provision and over-charging

for energy eﬃciency relative to the social optimum. To-date there has been almost
no discussion of the implication of the oligopolistic structure of the supply side
of the market in the policy implementation of ME appliance standards. Results
from this study suggest that such a discussion may be warranted.
