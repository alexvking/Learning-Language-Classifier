Bloedzuiger||&#x0D;&#x0A;Incidence:swamps and marshes&#x0D;&#x0A;Immunity: immune to poison; low immunity to stupefaction&#x0D;&#x0A;Susceptibility: sensitive to silver and fire&#x0D;&#x0A;Tactics: bloedzuigers can spit acid&#x0D;&#x0A;Ecosystem: are post-conjunction creatures; have no enemies among other monsters&#x0D;&#x0A;Alchemy: abomination lymph and bloedzuiger’s blood.&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A; Bloedzuigers, grotesque monsters from swamps, cause terror among peasants, because they pour digestive juices over the wounds of those who are still alive and then suck out their half-digested intestines.
Drowner||&#x0D;&#x0A;Incidence: drowners are creatures of the night; appear on banks of ponds, lakes and rivers. &#x0D;&#x0A;Immunity: cannot be poisoned or bled to death; are fearless, immune to stunning and Axii Sign.&#x0D;&#x0A;Susceptibility: very sensitive to silver and susceptible to attempted knockdown&#x0D;&#x0A;Tactics: usually attack in large groups and take advantage of numerical superiority&#x0D;&#x0A;Ecosystem: have no enemies among other monsters; among them the drowned dead can be found&#x0D;&#x0A;Alchemy: drowner’s brain tissue and ptomaine&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;Drowners are dishonorable creatures which ended their wicked lives in the water. Drowned alive or thrown into deep water after death, they turn into vengeful creatures lurking for inhabitants of coastal settlements. 
Drowned dead||&#x0D;&#x0A;Incidence: drowners are creatures of the night; appear on the banks of ponds, lakes and rivers.&#x0D;&#x0A;Immunity: cannot be poisoned or bled to death; are fearless, immune to stunning and Axii Sign.&#x0D;&#x0A;Susceptibility: sensitive to silver and susceptible to attempted knockdown&#x0D;&#x0A;Tactics: poison the victim with cadaverine; often attack with a group of drowned dead&#x0D;&#x0A;Ecosystem: have no enemies among other monsters; among them the drowned dead can be found; come ashore together with the drowners&#x0D;&#x0A;Alchemy: drowned dead’s tongue and cadaverine&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A; Particularly strong and dangerous drowners are commonly called the drowned dead. Simple people see no difference between the drowner and the drowned dead – encountering either of them is equally deadly for them. We might suppose though that most gloomy legends of drowned scoundrels concerns the drowned dead rather than the drowners. &#x0D;&#x0A;
Ghoul||&#x0D;&#x0A;Incidence: ghouls are encountered on battlefields, cemeteries and abandoned crypts.&#x0D;&#x0A;Immunity: ghouls are immune to common poisons.&#x0D;&#x0A;Susceptibility: sensitive to silver and anti-scavenger oil.&#x0D;&#x0A;Tactics: if opponents are knocked down, ghouls surround them and start eating them alive.&#x0D;&#x0A;Ecosystem: they are post-conjunction creatures; among them other scavengers can be found; have no enemies among other monsters.&#x0D;&#x0A;Alchemy: cadaverine and ghoul’s blood &#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A; Ghouls are said to have been humans, who were once forced to devour corpses and after many years spent in dark crypts they underwent a horrifying transformation. Their eternal hunger can only be fed with human meat, so they kill people and leave their remains in the recesses of crypts. &#x0D;&#x0A;
Alghoul||&#x0D;&#x0A;Incidence: Alghouls appear in old necropoles and crypts.&#x0D;&#x0A;Immunity: ghouls are immune to common poisons and attempted knockdown.&#x0D;&#x0A;Susceptibility: sensitive to silver.&#x0D;&#x0A;Tactics: try to knockdown victims and eat them alive. &#x0D;&#x0A;Ecosystem: are post-conjunction creatures; have no enemies among other monsters. &#x0D;&#x0A;Alchemy: alghoul’s marrow and cadaverine &#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A; Alghouls are the ghouls which have been devouring corpses for years and found human meat so tasty that they began to attack the living and ezt their still warm bodies. They are seen in crypts and battlefields, frequently surrounded by ghouls. Simple people do not notice the differences between scavengers, unlike the witchers, who know that alghouls are more agressive and demanding opponent.&#x0D;&#x0A;
Alp||&#x0D;&#x0A;Incidence: Alps hide in caves, ruins and abandoned houses, always near human settlements&#x0D;&#x0A;Immunity: are fearless and immune to attempted stunning and stupefaction&#x0D;&#x0A;Susceptibility: sensitive to silver and anti-vampire oil.&#x0D;&#x0A;Tactics: attack by surprise, try to daze the victims and suck out their blood. &#x0D;&#x0A;Ecosystem: alps are vampires, they were imprisoned in this world after the conjunction of spheres; at times they hunt in groups; they have no enemies among other monsters&#x0D;&#x0A;Alchemy: lymph of abomination and alp’s fangs&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A; No other monster is surrounded by so many myths and untrue statements as Alps are. People believe that this vampire is able to turn into a black dog or venomous toad. They claim them to be licentious and inclined to seducing handsome young men. Folk tales describe their charm, beautiful and seducing voice, as well as their disgust for virgins. Beyond all doubt it is true that they move noiselessly and attack by surprise, and their victims rarely have a chance even to scream in terror. &#x0D;&#x0A;
Archespor||&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;Incidence: archespors grow in places where particularly cruel crimes have been committed, or on the tomb of a victim of such a crime &#x0D;&#x0A;Immunity: are immune to any effects which influence mind (fear, stunning, Axii); they feel no pain and cannotbe poisoned or bleed to death. &#x0D;&#x0A;Susceptibility: are sensitive to silver and very susceptible to attempted arson.&#x0D;&#x0A;Tactics: archespors shoot with poisoned thorns.&#x0D;&#x0A;Ecosystem: are magical creatures, born out of curse, filled with hatred and bad will.&#x0D;&#x0A;Alchemy: archespor’s juices and spores&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A; Some crimes are so terrible that they cause horror among people and offend gods. Criminal’s bad will and the cruelty of his deed work as a curse, which brings archespor to life. The beast attacks innocent creatures with hatred, revenging on them until justice is done. &#x0D;&#x0A;
Barghest||&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;Incidence: barghests are ghosts and they come from the underworld only when summoned. &#x0D;&#x0A;Immunity: are fearless and cannotbe poisoned; coming from the underworld they acquire bodies, so they can be stunned and in pain, although they are immune to these factors as well. &#x0D;&#x0A;Susceptibility: are sensitive to silver and very susceptible to attempted knockdown.&#x0D;&#x0A;Tactics: they try to surround the opponent with a whole group – where one barghest appears, more will follow.&#x0D;&#x0A;Ecosystem: barghests are ghosts, which materialize as wild dogs, most frequently called for by a more mighty creature, a wizard or power of curse.&#x0D;&#x0A;Alchemy: beast’s liver and fangs.&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A; People say that barghests are phantoms which materialize as ghastly dogs and persecute the living. According to some folk tales monsters are the outpost of Wild Hunt. Other legends say that the ghosts appear as divine dispensation and they embody revenge. All tales agree on one point – barghests are merciless to the living. &#x0D;&#x0A;
Skullhead||&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;Incidence: those creatures died out centuries ago&#x0D;&#x0A;Immunity: strong skulls guarantee immunity to stunning, while low located centre of gravity make them hard to knockdown.&#x0D;&#x0A;Susceptibility: sensitive to silver&#x0D;&#x0A;Tactics: make use of their stout arms to stun and knock down the opponents&#x0D;&#x0A;Ecosystem: according to the archeologists from the University of Oxenfurt, skullheads lived in the world during the last glaciation.&#x0D;&#x0A;Alchemy: skullhead’s tendons and claws.&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A; All we know about skullheads , we know thanks to archaeological research. Skeleton reconstructions make it possible to describe the appearance and way of moving of the creature. The author of an excellent summary of research on skullheads is Professor Sędziwój Barren, who said to his students: ‘We are more than lucky that those sons of bitches died out’. &#x0D;&#x0A;
Basilisk||&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;Incidence: basilisks choose for their residence dark and damp places – caves or abandoned canal branches.&#x0D;&#x0A;Immunity: insusceptible to most poisons; it is hard to knock them out.&#x0D;&#x0A;Susceptibility: sensitive to silver and anti-ornithosaurus oil&#x0D;&#x0A;Tactics: Basilisk’s most threatening weapon is its venom – one of the strongest known toxins.&#x0D;&#x0A;Ecosystem: they are ornithosauruses, an indirect link between reptiles and birds; they have no enemies among other monsters. &#x0D;&#x0A;Alchemy: venomous glands&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;Simple people call basilisks the kings of Zerrikana deserts and often mistake them for cockatrices. They claim that the beast is filled with hatred towards all that is alive so much that even its breath is venomous and its glance turns to stone. In fairy tales, the only certain way to kill basilisks is by holding a mirror in front of their eyes. The witchers reply that it is better to hit the basilisk on its head with a mirror.&#x0D;&#x0A;

Bruxa||&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;Incidence: bruxas choose to live in ruins and abandoned human settlements, rarely in caves and grottos.&#x0D;&#x0A;Immunity: they are fearless and immune to attempted stunning and stupefaction.&#x0D;&#x0A;Susceptibility: sensitive to silver and anti-vampire oil.&#x0D;&#x0A;Tactics: they attack by surprise, try to daze the victims and suck out their blood.&#x0D;&#x0A;Ecosystem: bruxas are vampires even stronger than alps; they were imprisoned in this world after the conjunction of spheres; at times they hunt together; they have no enemies among other monsters.&#x0D;&#x0A;Alchemy: abomination lymph and bruxa’s blood&#x0D;&#x0A; It is said that bruxas haunt comely young men at night and suck their blood. Female vampires move quietly in the dark and emerge near their victims surprisingly. Bruxas may take shapes of beautiful girls, which makes them sometimes mistaken for water-nymphs, but their long fangs and unrestrained bloodthirst always betray them.&#x0D;&#x0A;
Graveir||&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;Incidence: Graveirs are rare, they are to be found on battlefields and cemeteries, like other necrophages.&#x0D;&#x0A;Immunity: they are immune to common poisons, attempted knockdown and stunning.&#x0D;&#x0A;Susceptibility: sensitive to silver and anti-scavenger oil.&#x0D;&#x0A;Tactics: try to knock down the victims and eat them alive.&#x0D;&#x0A;Ecosystem: they are post-conjunction creatures; they have no enemies among other monsters. &#x0D;&#x0A;Alchemy: graveir's jaw and cadaverine.&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A; Much has been written about ghouls and graveirs, since they are creatures to be encountered even by common people, who are attracted to war, or for some reason decide to visit a cemetery. Graveirs are rare, but when they appear in a necropolis, they take it over. All ghouls feel respect and have to bow to them &#x0D;&#x0A;
 Cockatrice||&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;Incidence: cockatrices nest in caves and dark cellars.&#x0D;&#x0A;Immunity: high immunity to poisons; it is even hard to knock them out&#x0D;&#x0A;Susceptibility: sensitive to silver and anti-reptile oil&#x0D;&#x0A;Tactics: Cockatrices try to surprise their opponents, hit suddenly and poison them with their venom.&#x0D;&#x0A;Ecosystem: they are ornithosauruses, an indirect link between reptiles and birds; they have no enemies among other monsters. &#x0D;&#x0A;Alchemy: cockatrice’s eyes and feathers.&#x0D;&#x0A; &#x0D;&#x0A;Cockatrices are born out of eggs laid by roosters mixing with other roosters. The egg is hatched by a toad which is to be devoured by the little beast as soon as the eggshell breaks. Cockatrice hates everything that is alive so much that its glance turns creatures into stone. The only certain way to defeat the monsters is by holding a mirror in front of their eyes. &#x0D;&#x0A;
 Dagon||&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;Incidence: Dagon is a mythical creature, reposing on the bottom of the lake near the village of Odmęty, according to the legend. &#x0D;&#x0A;Immunity: Dagon is a god, so he cannotbe killed.&#x0D;&#x0A;Susceptibility: The creature gets energy from his believers’ faith, which might be his only weakness.&#x0D;&#x0A;Tactics: When Dagon enters the land, destruction will walk along with him. &#x0D;&#x0A;Ecosystem: Dagon is worshipped by vodianoi and perhaps other inhabitants of the underwater domain.&#x0D;&#x0A;Alchemy: according to an ancient legend, Dagon secretions&#x0D;&#x0A; &#x0D;&#x0A; The one reposing for centuries is not dead, even death can die together with strange eons. &#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A; Powers older than humanity rest in the depth, where the sun never shines. Gods and demons sleep in underwater cities waiting for their time to come, for it has been said that when the hour comes, they will awake and bring annihilation to the world. One of those creatures is called Dagon. He rests on the bottom of the lake and is worshipped by vodianoi and lunatics living on the land, haunted by nightmares. Dagon embodies strength and fury, and when he comes ashore, he embodies destruction. Forbidden books, for instance Hymns of Madness and Despair describe the ways to call for him, because he can be called in a place dedicated to him.&#x0D;&#x0A;
 Dog||&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;Incidence: dogs are domesticated animals; even wild dogs go around human settlements.&#x0D;&#x0A;Immunity: No immunity &#x0D;&#x0A;Susceptibility: susceptible to fear and attempted knockdown&#x0D;&#x0A;Tactics: they attack in groups, taking advantage of numerical superiority.&#x0D;&#x0A;Ecosystem: domesticated dogs attack all enemies of their masters.&#x0D;&#x0A;Alchemy: beast’s fangs.&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A; Whoever claims that dog is man’s best friend, has probably never tamed viverna.&#x0D;&#x0A;Anonymous druid. &#x0D;&#x0A;
Echinops||&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;Incidence: echinopses grow in places where crimes have been committed or on tombs of victims.&#x0D;&#x0A;Immunity: are immune to any effects which influence mind (fear, stunning, Axii); they feel no pain and cannotbe poisoned or bleed to death. &#x0D;&#x0A;Susceptibility: are sensitive to silver and very susceptible to attempted arson.&#x0D;&#x0A;Tactics: echinopses grow into the ground, but they shoot with poisoned thorns.&#x0D;&#x0A;Ecosystem: are magical creatures, born out of curse, filled with hatred and bad will.&#x0D;&#x0A;Alchemy: echinops root-stock and spores&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A; Echinopses, monstrous plants, grown in places where terrible crimes were committed. The beasts strive for revenge on criminals, but they do not save innocent wretches, led into the area by bad fate. &#x0D;&#x0A;
Experiment F||&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;Incidence: created by Salamandra&#x0D;&#x0A;Immunity: ***&#x0D;&#x0A;Susceptibility: ***&#x0D;&#x0A;Tactics: quick and agile&#x0D;&#x0A;Ecosystem: experiments F are inept mutants; born as a result of research on creating ideal mutants.&#x0D;&#x0A;Alchemy: beast’s brain stem and fangs.&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A; It seems that the proposed way of mutation leads nowhere. As a result of transformation quick, guilty and aggressive creatures are born; they lack intelligence, though. They are closer to animals than humans. It does not mean, of course, that we will not find any practical use for them. On the contrary, simplified mutating procedures guarantee that we can create many experiments F, which are perfect tools to extend chaos and terror. &#x0D;&#x0A;
Experiment S||&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;Incidence: created by Salamandra&#x0D;&#x0A;Immunity: ***&#x0D;&#x0A;Susceptibility: ***&#x0D;&#x0A;Tactics: quick and agile&#x0D;&#x0A;Ecosystem: experiments S are inept mutants; born as a result of research on creating ideal mutants.&#x0D;&#x0A;Alchemy: beast’s brain stem and fangs.&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A; Experiment S failed our expectations. It turned out to be a beastly mutant with superhuman power, scary cruelty and scarce intelligence. Fortunately, our masters were satisfied. Experiment S has its place in their plans. I even think that our masters’ plan is mainly based on using such creatures. &#x0D;&#x0A;
Fleder||&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;Incidence: Fleders usually hunt in rundown city districts; they are also found near cemeteries and in the wilderness. &#x0D;&#x0A;Immunity: they are fearless and immune to attempted stunning and stupefaction.&#x0D;&#x0A;Susceptibility: sensitive to silver and anti-vampire oil.&#x0D;&#x0A;Tactics: they nosedive the opponent from the air, try to daze the victims and suck their blood.&#x0D;&#x0A;Ecosystem: fleders are lower vampires, imprisoned in this world after the conjunction of spheres; they usually hunt in groups; they have no enemies among other monsters &#x0D;&#x0A;Alchemy: abomination lymph and avian membrane&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A; Common people believe that fleders are dead atheists, who turn into vampires and come out of their tombs after burial. Being vampires they bite sleeping people and suck their blood. According to the peasants, a man bit by a fleder becomes a fleder himself, which is an obvious nonsense. &#x0D;&#x0A;
Frightener||&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;Incidence: frighteners are very rare; they come into being as a result of magical experiments. &#x0D;&#x0A;Immunity: *** &#x0D;&#x0A;Susceptibility: sensitive to steel and silver; very sensitive to loud sounds at high frequency.&#x0D;&#x0A;Tactics: in combat, frighteners rely on their size and strength; they try to knock down the opponents and then deliver a lethal blow. &#x0D;&#x0A;Ecosystem: are created as a result of magical experiments; to create a frightener, the magician must possess basic knowledge about mutations and great power.&#x0D;&#x0A;Alchemy: frightener’s claws and eyes&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A; The first wizard to have created a frightener was an infamous renegade Dagobert Sulla, a diligent student of Zerrikana masters of alchemy and the supervisor of Grass Test carried out in Kaer Morhen. Having noticed how scary frighteners are, Sulla said: ‘What have I done’ and he destroyed the monster. However, his notes were not destroyed.&#x0D;&#x0A;
Garkain||&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;Incidence: garkains are to be found most frequently at the cemeteries, or near abandoned buildings, where they nest&#x0D;&#x0A;Immunity: they are fearless and immune to attempted stunning and stupefaction.&#x0D;&#x0A;Susceptibility: sensitive to silver and anti-vampire oil.&#x0D;&#x0A;Tactics: they try to daze the victims and suck their blood.&#x0D;&#x0A;Ecosystem: Garkains are minor vampires, imprisoned in this world after the conjunction of spheres; they usually hunt in groups; they have no enemies among other monsters.&#x0D;&#x0A;Alchemy: garkain’s saliva and abomination lymph. &#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A; Garkains, the filthiest of vampires, even exceed fleders with their ugliness, and since fleders are well-known for their ugliness, it is easy to imagine how abominable beasts garkains are. As befits vampires, the creatures suck blood, although they do not despise fresh meat, or even carcass. Garkains are mistaken for gargoyles, because they lurk on building roofs waiting for the victims and nosedive straight at them on membranous wings.&#x0D;&#x0A;
Golem||&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;Incidence: Golem is a creature made of stone or wood, brought to life by a wizard and animated with the use of magic.&#x0D;&#x0A;Immunity: tough body is insensitive to sword blows and most effects.&#x0D;&#x0A;Susceptibility: golem can be stopped by his maker; usually the giant is set in motion by means of thunder, so a major electric shock might stop or even annihilate him as well.&#x0D;&#x0A;Tactics: he uses his superhuman power to knock down the opponent, stun and crush him. &#x0D;&#x0A;Ecosystem: golems are wizards’ guards or servants, difficult to make and therefore exceptionally rare.&#x0D;&#x0A;Alchemy: golem’s heart is made of obsidian.&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A; One absent-minded wizard created golem, animated him by casting Alzur’s Thunder and ordered his new servant to carry water, burying himself in scholarly books. Golem kept carrying water unceasingly, and finally not only the wizard’s house, but the whole city was flooded. As you might see, my young disciples of Art, an improper use of working tools and a lack of elementary training may cause tragedy.&#x0D;&#x0A;Anabelle Radfind, Lectures on Security and Hygiene of Magic. &#x0D;&#x0A;
Graveir||&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;Incidence: graveirs appear wherever they find food, that is carcass, preferably human corpses.&#x0D;&#x0A;Immunity: they are immune to common poisons and attempted knockdown; thick skin and muscle plexuses protect them from blows&#x0D;&#x0A;Susceptibility: sensitive to silver and anti-scavenger oil.&#x0D;&#x0A;Tactics: try to knock down the victims and eat them alive.&#x0D;&#x0A;Ecosystem: they are post-conjunction creatures; they have no enemies among other monsters. &#x0D;&#x0A;Alchemy: graveir's bone and cadaverine.&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A; After the war against Nilfgaard graveirs became a real plague. The monster used to be familiar only to specialists, professional beast killers, and nobody else was able to call it or mistook it for ghoul. Today every child describes graveirs correctly, and people who live near battlefields and necropoles complete these descriptions with tales of horrible murders committed by those ruthless necrophages. &#x0D;&#x0A;
Devourer||&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;Incidence: they live near human settlements in caves and ruins &#x0D;&#x0A;Immunity: immune to conventional poisons and attempted knockdowns.&#x0D;&#x0A;Susceptibility: sensitive to silver and anti-scavenger oil.&#x0D;&#x0A;Tactics: try to knock down the victims and eat them alive.&#x0D;&#x0A;Ecosystem: they are scavengers, but they do not have a lot in common with ghouls and graveirs; they are characterized by vicious intelligence and before killing and devouring victims they like torturing them. &#x0D;&#x0A;Alchemy: cadaverine and devourer’s teeth&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A; Devourers are often called night witches, cause they resemble old, ugly women and are famous for their witch-like viciousness. Those creatures feed themselves with human meat, and although they willingly eat carcass, they prefer fresh and still warm meat to all. Devourers go hunting after dark and for the time of hunting they form groups called sabbaths by peasants. They like to deceive their victims and torture them, but the tales of their night broomstick flights and gingerbread houses, where they are believed to live, are untrue.&#x0D;&#x0A;
Hellhound||&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;Incidence: might appear wherever dishonorable people live&#x0D;&#x0A;Immunity: immune to most effects; it is a material creature, so you may try to knock down or stun it, but it is hard.&#x0D;&#x0A;Susceptibility: might be wounded with a steel sword.&#x0D;&#x0A;Tactics: able to call for barghests, they see opponents in a ring of fire and mutilates them.&#x0D;&#x0A;Ecosystem: Hellhound arrives from the underworld, attacks human settlements murdering their inhabitants; nobody has yet been able to remove the curse and chase the beast away.&#x0D;&#x0A;Alchemy: ghastly trace. &#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A; Hellhound, referred to as Beast, is an underworld creature, a specter that assumes the form of a terrifying hound that stays on the trail of its victim once it finds that trail. Peasants believe the Hellhound embodies the vengeance of the gods, who impart the Beast on humans as punishment for their iniquity. &#x0D;&#x0A;
Ifrit||&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;Incidence: Sphere of Fire is the house of ifrits &#x0D;&#x0A;Immunity: immune to most effects, especially to fire; comes from another world, so it can be dazed and stunned.&#x0D;&#x0A;Susceptibility: sensitive to silver and anti-specter oil&#x0D;&#x0A;Tactics: floats in the air; uses fire in combat.&#x0D;&#x0A;Ecosystem: ifrits are underworld creatures, partly unmaterial, but regarding them as ghosts is a mistake; wizards which master the element of fire are able to call for ifrits and force them to serve.&#x0D;&#x0A;Alchemy: pyrites. &#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A; Ifrit is a minor genius of fire, or – as some say, elementar. It does not fulfillwishes, build palaces or make anybody rich, but truly serves magicians researching the element of fire and are able to force fire creatures to be obedient.&#x0D;&#x0A;Ifrites can only be captured by a wizard, who understands well the nature of flames and has devoted himself completely to research on their secrets. The creatures detect connections with the element of fire and if they find the wizard trustworthy, they willingly arrive when called for, and then loyally serve fulfilling all orders &#x0D;&#x0A;
Kikimore queen||&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;Incidence: queen chooses quiet, damp and dark places, where she can lay eggs in peace, for instance caves in damp areas.&#x0D;&#x0A;Immunity: immune to all effects; due to a very thick armour, she is very hard to injure whether with silver or steel sword.&#x0D;&#x0A;Susceptibility: kikimore queen moves very slowly – it’s her only weak point.&#x0D;&#x0A;Tactics: her one blow can knock down and kill a man.&#x0D;&#x0A;Ecosystem: kikimore queen lives surrounded by her children and together with them she forms a community similar to an ant community; kikimores have no enemies among other monsters.&#x0D;&#x0A;Alchemy: kikimore queen’s nerve &#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A; Some scientists claim that kikimores behave like ants. They are divided into workers doing all jobs and warriors protecting them. Life in a kikimore colony is centered around the great female, procreating unceasingly. The landscape around queen’s residence looks like a desert – only skeletons remained after creatures which didn’t move when they should have moved, and even birds don’t chirp on branches of trees. &#x0D;&#x0A;
Kikimore worker||&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;Incidence: kikimore workers rarely appear far from colonies, unless in search for food.&#x0D;&#x0A;Immunity: insusceptible to blinding and attempts to cause bleeding; immune to stupefaction, but they can be dazed.&#x0D;&#x0A; Susceptibility: sensitive to silver and anti-insectoid oil.&#x0D;&#x0A;Tactics: they are blind, but they sense shocks and smells; they spit with acid.&#x0D;&#x0A;Ecosystem: they aren’t aggressive unless provoked or ordered by a warrior; with other kikimores they communicate by producing pheromones.&#x0D;&#x0A;Alchemy: trachea and toxin.&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A; Kikomores are a divine insult, the filthiest creatures on Earth. They are repulsive due to their resemblance to spiders, and even the smallest of them, the workers, are dangerous. So say the uneducated, superstitious and stupid people. And the truth is different ! Kikimore workers rarely appear near human settlements, and even then they only attack when threatened. Does anything more beautiful than kikimore, the symbol of hard work, resourcefulness and caution, exist ?&#x0D;&#x0A;Master Dorgeray, The Wonderful World of Insectoids. &#x0D;&#x0A;
Kikimore warrior||&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;Incidence: kikimore warriors protect their queen and workers digging tunnels or looking for food.&#x0D;&#x0A;Immunity: immune to most effects, including blinding; can be bewildered and dazed&#x0D;&#x0A; Susceptibility: sensitive to silver and anti-insectoid oil&#x0D;&#x0A;Tactics: in combat they spit acid which blinds the opponent and paralyzes with pain.&#x0D;&#x0A;Ecosystem: kikimore warriors are aggressive; they have no enemies among other monsters &#x0D;&#x0A;Alchemy: tracheas and toxin&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;More abominable beasts are hard to find. Neither a cockroach, nor a spider, they make ladies and gentlemen faint, and they stink of swamp. For this reason I firmly demand to remove exhibit no.88 from the university assembly hall. And anticipating the question: what to do with it then, I answer: throw it into manure.&#x0D;&#x0A;From an application to the Oxenfurt University rector. &#x0D;&#x0A;
Bonar||&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;Incidence: a mythical creature, born out of magic.&#x0D;&#x0A;Immunity: ***&#x0D;&#x0A; Susceptibility: *** &#x0D;&#x0A;Tactics: ***&#x0D;&#x0A; Ecosystem: bonar is a magical creature, only a mighty wizard, capable of performing mutation, can bring bonar to life. &#x0D;&#x0A;Alchemy: bonar heart.&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;By the way, what do you think the bonar is ?&#x0D;&#x0A; I’m afraid it’s death. &#x0D;&#x0A;
&#x0D;&#x0A;Brothers majors, Auxilia||&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;Incidence: reconnaissance and raid on enemy’s territory; they support the assault divisions. &#x0D;&#x0A;Immunity: they don’t feel fear or pain; they are immune to enchantment, including Axii Sign; they can’t be disarmed; they are insensitive to Precise Hit, knockdown and stunning. &#x0D;&#x0A; Susceptibility: can by injured with steel weapons. &#x0D;&#x0A;Tactics: quick and mobile; their combat skills match those of assault divisions, although their armours are worse; they produce precise hits which cause pain.&#x0D;&#x0A; Ecosystem: they are mutants, born out of experiments with witchers’ receipts and potions; they serve the Order of Flaming Rose loyally. &#x0D;&#x0A;Alchemy: mutagen and brain stem.&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A; inflexible confidence, strength and courage – are Auxilia’s devices. These virtues are indispensable for victory, but not sufficient. Basic rules of war must not be ignored. Forming new units of knights we have to remember about auxiliary divisions, which will provide the army with more flexibility on battlefields around the world. &#x0D;&#x0A;
Brothers majors, assault divisions||&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;Incidence: basic striking force in new divisions of the Order of Flaming Rose.&#x0D;&#x0A;Immunity: they feel neither fear nor pain; they are resistant to charm, including Axii Sign; they can’t be disarmed and are insensitive to knockdown and stunning. &#x0D;&#x0A; Susceptibility: they can be injured with a steel weapon.&#x0D;&#x0A;Tactics: they are slow but well armed and strong; they use weapons skillfully; a blow may stun them.&#x0D;&#x0A;Ecosystem: they are mutants, born out of experimentswith witchers’ recipes and potions; superhumans, ideal warriors, they serve loyally to the Order of the Flaming Rose. &#x0D;&#x0A;Alchemy: mutagen and brain stem.&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A; With great pride and responsibility I have to state that the experiment was successful. The race of superhumans raised by us meets more than all expectations and will satisfy Jacob of Aldersburg. The combination of intelligence, endurance and brutal force to be tamed only through loyalty to the Flaming Rose is the future of the world. &#x0D;&#x0A;
Order hound||&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;Incidence: the beasts are trained and put to combat by guards (brothers majors). &#x0D;&#x0A;Immunity: they are immune to precise hits and stunning. &#x0D;&#x0A; Susceptibility: they can be injured with steel blades.&#x0D;&#x0A;Tactics: order hounds are led by mutated beast guards; they fight as resupplies of other formations.&#x0D;&#x0A;Ecosystem: they are mutated and armoured animals; unusually aggressive and fierce.&#x0D;&#x0A;Alchemy: mutagen and beast’s fangs. &#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A; During the first stage of research we performed experiments on animals only. Having raised a mutated hound we were sure that the recipes for potions are suitable and if we apply them to transformation of humans, we will receive exactly the result we wanted. &#x0D;&#x0A;
Midnighter||&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;Incidence: midnighters appear on fields and meadows; they can be found after dark, when the moon is high. &#x0D;&#x0A;Immunity: they are insusceptible to blinding and attempts to cause bleeding; they are fearless and resistant to poisons.&#x0D;&#x0A;Susceptibility: sensitive to silver and anti-specter oil.&#x0D;&#x0A;Tactics: they are able to grasp the moonlight and blind their enemies with it.&#x0D;&#x0A;Ecosystem: they are spectres, but at the same time creatures strictly related with the world of nature; they perceive the living, but can’t comprehend them, because the dead is unable to hear the living.&#x0D;&#x0A;Alchemy: shadowy dust and ectoplasm.&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A; Midnighters are born out of moonlight, wind and earth cooling down after heat of the day. They rise above the ground and whirl in mad dancing, which can't be seen by any mortal. When caught peeping, the mortal is blinded by the moonlight and then seized to the circle and forced to dance until death; at times becomes midnighter himself. &#x0D;&#x0A;
Nooner||&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;Incidence: nooners haunt cultivated fields and meadows; they always appear when the sun is high.&#x0D;&#x0A;Immunity: insusceptible to blinding and attempts to cause bleeding; they are fearless and resistant to poisons. &#x0D;&#x0A;Susceptibility: sensitive to silver and anti-specter oil.&#x0D;&#x0A;Tactics: they are able to grasp sunrays and blind their enemies with them.&#x0D;&#x0A;Ecosystem: they are spectres, but at the same time creatures strictly connected with the world of nature; they perceive the living, but they can’t comprehend them, because the dead are unable to hear the living. &#x0D;&#x0A;Alchemy: bright dust and ectoplasm.&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A; Nooners are born at noon sharp out of heat, sadness and ploughman’s sweat. In the hot air above the fields they gather to dance madly, which causes air whirlpools. Noon demons don’t like anybody to watch them. Those who peep are seized to dance, to be terminated only when the sun goes down, and the kidnapped has long been dead from fear and exhaustion.&#x0D;&#x0A;
Scolopendromorph||&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;Incidence: scolopendromorphs are encountered in forests or on meadows, in places full of hide-aways.&#x0D;&#x0A;Immunity: insusceptible to blinding and attempts to cause bleeding; resistant to stupefaction and attempted knockdowns. &#x0D;&#x0A;Susceptibility: sensitive to silver and anti-insectoid oil;&#x0D;&#x0A;Tactics: they are blind, but they sense tremors; in combat they try to knock down the opponents and poison them with their acid venom, which causes pain. &#x0D;&#x0A;Ecosystem: simple nervous system makes them see the enemy and at the same time food in every creature.&#x0D;&#x0A;Alchemy: venomous glands and toxin.&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A; They seem to have been raised in Brokilon and released to the world by negeful dryads which hate people. They are believed to be impossible to kill, as they are transformed into two separate beasts when cut in half. All those nonsense tales about scolopendromorphs only show how much common people are afraid of these venomous beasts. And how much they hate no-humans. &#x0D;&#x0A;
Wild Hunt||&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;Incidence: Wild Hunt appears in the sky as the forerunner of war and other misfortunes. &#x0D;&#x0A;Immunity: no information concerning attempted fight with Wild Hunt. &#x0D;&#x0A;Susceptibility: no information concerning attempted fight with Wild Hunt. &#x0D;&#x0A;Tactics: Wild Hunt warriors do not have to fight, they cause terror so huge that people cower seeing them; there are known instances of kidnappings made by Wild Hunt.&#x0D;&#x0A;Ecosystem: Some scientists claim Wild Hunt to be a magic phenomenon rather than a horde of spectres.&#x0D;&#x0A;Alchemy: vapors of the hunt.&#x0D;&#x0A; &#x0D;&#x0A; Wild Hunt is a horde of spectres floating in the sky during storm, forecasting a disaster. The appearance of Wild Hunt foreshadows war and misfortunes, just like the occurrence of a comet. The spectral Wild Hunt sometimes appears in nightmares of the haunted or touched by Destiny. &#x0D;&#x0A;
Striga||&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;Incidence: striga needs a hide-away for the day and often chooses abandoned branches of crypts and underground ruins.&#x0D;&#x0A;Immunity: ***&#x0D;&#x0A;Susceptibility: sensitive to silver.&#x0D;&#x0A;Tactics: striga is a very strong and agile creature, but not as durable as it might seem; they attack by surprise and try to tear opponents to pieces, without giving them a chance to fight back.&#x0D;&#x0A;Ecosystem: striga is born out of a curse; filled with hatred and bad will; hates all creatures and feeds with their bodies; tolerates only scavengers, if so.&#x0D;&#x0A;Alchemy: striga’s heart.&#x0D;&#x0A; &#x0D;&#x0A;’Where does it come from ? Spells, magic ?’ &#x0D;&#x0A; I have no idea, King. The Knowing research these phenomena. For us, witchers, it is enough to know that focused will may cause them. And the knowledge how to fight them.’ ‘&#x0D;&#x0A; ‘Kill ?’ &#x0D;&#x0A;’Most frequently so. This is what we are mostly paid for. Hardly anyone wants to remove spells, King. Usually people only want to protect themselves. And if the monster has killed people, revenge is another cause.’ &#x0D;&#x0A;
Vetala||&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;Incidence: according to the legend, Vetala lives on the city cemetery in Visima. &#x0D;&#x0A;Immunity: immune to common poisons and attempted knockdowns; thick skin and muscle plexuses protect from blows.&#x0D;&#x0A;Susceptibility: sensitive to silver and anti-scavenger oil.&#x0D;&#x0A;Tactics: tries to knock down and eat alive the victim.&#x0D;&#x0A;Ecosystem: highly intelligent creature; other necrophages have respect for Vetala. &#x0D;&#x0A;Alchemy: graveir’s bone and cadaverine. &#x0D;&#x0A; &#x0D;&#x0A; Vetala is a mythical beast, invented by common people, whose tales are typical examples of urban legends, passed from one mouth to another, and in this way getting more and more incredible. Vetala is believed to be an intelligent ghoul, or graveir, living on the city cemetery as the absolute ruler among scavengers. Not only does Vetala speak human language, but is also characterized by refined manners. Vetala is said to prefer corpses and rarely attacks the living, and even if so, shows unusual courtesy. &#x0D;&#x0A;
Vodianoi, priest||&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;Incidence: rarely come ashore, unless they lead a division of warriors, or for religious cause.&#x0D;&#x0A;Immunity: immune to attempted arson and charm; immune to blinding. &#x0D;&#x0A;Susceptibility: when successfully set on fire, they turn out to be sensitive to fire.&#x0D;&#x0A;Tactics: priests support their warriors with magic – they are able to cure allies and blind the opponents.&#x0D;&#x0A;Ecosystem: they hate drowners; they attack people only when provoked. &#x0D;&#x0A;Alchemy: vodian’s bladder and scales&#x0D;&#x0A; &#x0D;&#x0A; Vodianoi are an ancient and sensible race. They worship their gods, and their priests deal with divine matters. Among fishpeople cults of underwater forces are developed – either unknown or threatening to people. Underwater forces lend their powers to priests, enabling them to cast curses and spells. &#x0D;&#x0A;
Vodianoi, warrior||&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;Incidence: they come ashore to protect their underwater domains or raid people.&#x0D;&#x0A;Immunity: immune to attempted arson and blinding.&#x0D;&#x0A;Susceptibility: when set on fire, turns out to be sensitive to fire.&#x0D;&#x0A;Tactics: they grease their claws with oil which causes pain; they are often supported by priests.&#x0D;&#x0A;Ecosystem: vodianoi hate drowners; they only attack people when provoked. &#x0D;&#x0A;Alchemy: vodian’s bladder and scales&#x0D;&#x0A; &#x0D;&#x0A; The appearance of vodianoi warriors ashore is a visible sign that people have crossed the border of underwater kingdom or violated taboo of one of many fishpeople religions. Warriors are first of all the guards of underwater kingdom, and in the second place invaders revenging for their harm. Both tasks are performed precisely and without emotions. They do not hesitate to sacrifice their lives serving underwater forces.&#x0D;&#x0A;
Werewolf||&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;Incidence: werewolves live near human settlements &#x0D;&#x0A;Immunity: they are resistant to steel and most effects.&#x0D;&#x0A;Susceptibility: sensitive to silver.&#x0D;&#x0A;Tactics: they attack with fury and prefer attack, trusting their resistance to conventional weapon.&#x0D;&#x0A;Ecosystem: werewolves are lycantrops, i.e. they change their shapes; they are born as a result of curse.&#x0D;&#x0A; Alchemy: werewolf’s hair&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A; Baron Wolfstein hid his face in hands, and his throat was throbbing. Suddenly the scent of his wife and children’s blood became more intense. Baron’s body swelled with muscles and his excellent outfit fell torn on the marble floor. ‘My beloved, you... you are hairy. You are a werewolf !’, Bianca went pale, ‘what about our love ?’. She was replied with a frightful roar.&#x0D;&#x0A;Danielle Stone, The Curse of Baron Wolfstein and other love stories. &#x0D;&#x0A;
Viverna||&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;Incidence: vivernas live in the wilderness or near human settlements. &#x0D;&#x0A;Immunity: resistant to stunning, poisons and precise hits.&#x0D;&#x0A;Susceptibility: sensitive to silver and anti-ornithosaurus oil.&#x0D;&#x0A;Tactics: they nosedive at opponents, try to knock down and poison them with venom.&#x0D;&#x0A;Ecosystem: vivernas fit natural ecosystems well; they are willingly tamed by druids.&#x0D;&#x0A; Alchemy: toxin and volatile membrane. &#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A; Vivernas are unlucky to be frequently mistaken for dragons. Seeing a reptile approaching a flock of sheep, paesants start to panic. They expect them to breathe fire, massacre and the whole virgin thing. It is true that viverna hunt for sheep, but they don’t breathe fire or threaten whole villages. To virgins they are completely indifferent.&#x0D;&#x0A;
Viverna, female||&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;Incidence: vivernas live in the wilderness or near human settlements. &#x0D;&#x0A;Immunity: resistant to stunning, poisons and precise hits.&#x0D;&#x0A;Susceptibility: sensitive to silver and anti-ornithosaurus oil.&#x0D;&#x0A;Tactics: they nosedive the opponents, try to knock down and poison them with venom.&#x0D;&#x0A;Ecosystem: vivernas fit natural ecosystems well; they are willingly tamed by druids.&#x0D;&#x0A; Alchemy: toxin and avian membrane. &#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A; Female vivernas are smaller and weaker than males, but more venomous. Their example shows that male-female relations are a result of evolution in the world of nature. Which was to be proven.&#x0D;&#x0A; Master Dorgeray, Against the Institution of Marriage. &#x0D;&#x0A;
Spectre||&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;Incidence: spectres haunt the places where they died or their tombs.&#x0D;&#x0A;Immunity: insusceptible to blinding and attempts to cause bleeding; they are fearless and resistant to poisons; immune to attempted stunning and stupefaction or precise hits. &#x0D;&#x0A;Susceptibility: sensitive to silver and anti-specter oil&#x0D;&#x0A;Tactics: suffering experienced by the haunted makes wounds caused by them painful.&#x0D;&#x0A;Ecosystem: spectres do not belong in this world, sometimes they return called for by magic, but more frequently unfinished business makes them stay.&#x0D;&#x0A; Alchemy: deadly dust and ectoplasm.&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A; If you want to get rid of the spectre, you must find his body first. Try searching on unhallowed ground, or in the corner of a cemetery where outlaws are buried. When you dig out their corpses, you will discover that they are not rotten, and there is blood on their mouths. Pierce the corpse with a stake, cut off their head, put it between their legs and to make sure, set the haunted on fire. The spectre will then never return. Unless you’ve blown it – then you’re gone.&#x0D;&#x0A;
Wolf||&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;Incidence: wolves live in the wilderness, when they are hungry they approach human settlements and hunt for raised animals. &#x0D;&#x0A;Immunity: no immunity&#x0D;&#x0A;Susceptibility: susceptible to attempted knockdowns.&#x0D;&#x0A;Tactics: they attack in groups, taking advantage of numerical superiority.&#x0D;&#x0A;Ecosystem: wolves usually hunt for other animals, but if they are hungry, they can attack humans as well.&#x0D;&#x0A; Alchemy: beast’s fangs.&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A; That winter there was so much snow that we had to dig tunnels to get to the privy. Whoever came back, they had icicles in their pants. Wolves came out of the forest and when they devoured cattle, they surrounded the house. They were howling madly. Surrounded by a pack of wolves we felt like three little pigs.&#x0D;&#x0A;
Zeugl||&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;Incidence: zeugls live in dirt – in sewers or waste dumps&#x0D;&#x0A;Immunity: almost insensitive to sword blows, whether steel or silver.&#x0D;&#x0A;Susceptibility: to kill zeugls their tentacles must be removed first.&#x0D;&#x0A;Tactics: they bomb their opponents with numerous tentacle hits&#x0D;&#x0A;Ecosystem: zeugl must be killed young and small; when grown, they do not fear any opponent.&#x0D;&#x0A; Alchemy: zeugl’s venom&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A; Zeugls are the best example of a monster adjusting to life near human settlements. The beasts feed themselves with waste and dirt produced in the city, so they don’t have to hunt or fight for their existence. They simply grow and gradually become dangerous for people. This is an example which shows that degradation of natural environment doesn’t pay in the long run. Therefore I’m appealing: let’s respect nature. &#x0D;&#x0A;
