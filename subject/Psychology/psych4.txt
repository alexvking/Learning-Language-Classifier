Background: Previous functional neuroimaging studies have demonstrated exaggerated amygdala responses
and diminished medial prefrontal cortex responses during the symptomatic state in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
Objectives: To determine whether these abnormalities also occur in response to overtly presented affective
stimuli unrelated to trauma; to examine the functional
relationship between the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex and their relationship to PTSD symptom severity in response to these stimuli; and to determine
whether responsivity of these regions habituates normally across repeated stimulus presentations in PTSD.
Design: Case-control study.
Setting: Academic medical center.
Participants: Volunteer sample of 13 men with PTSD

(PTSD group) and 13 trauma-exposed men without PTSD
(control group).
Main Outcome Measures: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study blood oxygen-

ation level–dependent signal during the presentation of
emotional facial expressions.
Results: The PTSD group exhibited exaggerated amygdala responses and diminished medial prefrontal cortex responses to fearful vs happy facial expressions. In addition,
in the PTSD group, blood oxygenation level–dependent signal changes in the amygdala were negatively correlated with
signal changes in the medial prefrontal cortex, and symptom severity was negatively related to blood oxygenation
level–dependent signal changes in the medial prefrontal cortex. Finally, relative to the control group, the PTSD group
tended to exhibit diminished habituation of fearful vs happy
responses in the right amygdala across functional runs, although this effect did not exceed our a priori statistical
threshold.
Conclusions: These results provide evidence for exaggerated amygdala responsivity, diminished medial prefrontal cortex responsivity, and a reciprocal relationship between these 2 regions during passive viewing of
overtly presented affective stimuli unrelated to trauma
in PTSD.

neuroimaging studies have
provided evidence consistent with amygdala hyperresponsivity during exposure to
traumatic reminders in posttraumatic
stress disorder (PTSD).1-6 In addition,
PTSD symptom severity is positively correlated with blood flow in the amygdala
during such exposure.3,5,7
To characterize the scope of amygdala
hyperresponsivity in PTSD, it is important to determine whether amygdala responses to stimuli unrelated to trauma are
also exaggerated in this disorder. Previous research has established that the normal human amygdala is responsive to fa-

cial expressions of fear 8 - 1 1 and that
individuals with PTSD exhibit exaggerated amygdala responses to these facial expressions. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), Rauch and
colleagues 12 measured blood oxygenation level–dependent (BOLD) signal responses to backwardly masked fearful and
happy facial expressions in combat veterans with and without PTSD. In that study,
the fearful and happy facial expressions
were presented very briefly (33 milliseconds) and were followed immediately by
neutral facial expressions.11 Relative to the
control group, the PTSD group exhibited
greater BOLD signal increases in the right
amygdala in response to masked fearful vs

happy facial expressions. In addition, PTSD symptom severity was positively correlated with BOLD signal changes
in the amygdala. Whether amygdala hyperresponsivity
in PTSD can be demonstrated when participants are explicitly aware of the presence of emotional facial expressions is not known. In addition, whether this amygdala
hyperresponsivity declines normally across repeatedstimulus presentations has never been assessed in PTSD.
Medial prefrontal structures also have been implicated in the pathophysiology of PTSD. Several functional neuroimaging studies have demonstrated relatively diminished activation in the subcallosal,13,14 anterior
cingulate,15-17 and medial frontal gyri5,16 in this disorder.
In addition, PTSD symptom severity is negatively correlated with blood flow in the medial frontal gyrus during
traumatic imagery and recollection.5 Furthermore, blood
flow changes in the medial frontal gyrus appear to be negatively correlated with changes in the amygdala during traumatic imagery in PTSD.5 These findings highlight the potential importance of interactions between the amygdala
and medial prefrontal structures in this disorder. However, whether such interactions can be observed during
the presentation of more general, affective stimuli unrelated to trauma is unknown.
The goals of the present study were to determine
whether (1) individuals with PTSD exhibit exaggerated
amygdala responses and diminished medial prefrontal responses to nonmasked (ie, overtly presented) fearful vs
happy facial expressions; (2) there is a reciprocal relationship between BOLD signal changes in the amygdala
and medial prefrontal regions in this contrast; (3) symptom severity is related to signal changes in the amygdala
and medial prefrontal regions; and (4) the amygdala and
medial prefrontal responses to fearful vs happy faces habituate normally in patients with PTSD.
We studied fMRI BOLD signal in trauma-exposed men
with and without PTSD while they viewed blocks of emotional facial expressions. In the fearful vs happy comparison, we predicted that participants with PTSD would
exhibit greater activation in the amygdala12 and diminished activation in medial prefrontal regions (including
medial frontal, anterior cingulate, and subcallosal gyri),
compared with participants without PTSD. In addition,
we predicted that fMRI BOLD signal changes in the amygdala would be negatively correlated with signal changes
in medial prefrontal regions in the fearful vs happy contrast.5 We also predicted that symptom severity would
be positively correlated with responses in the amygdala5,7,12 and negatively correlated with those in medial
prefrontal regions.5 Finally, we predicted that, relative
to the control group, the PTSD group would show diminished habituation of amygdala responses over repeated presentations of fearful vs happy expressions.
METHODS

PARTICIPANTS
Participants included 26 trauma-exposed men without a history of head injury, neurological disorders, or other major medical conditions. Thirteen participants met DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for current PTSD (PTSD group), and 13 never had PTSD

(control group) according to a structured clinical interview (the
Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale [CAPS]).18 Twenty-four participants were right-handed, and 2 (1 in the PTSD and 1 in the
control group) were left-handed.19 Participants had served in
combat in Vietnam (10 in the PTSD and 8 in the control group)
or were firefighters (3 in the PTSD and 5 in the control group).
Examples of Vietnam experiences included being wounded or
in mortal danger in combat, witnessing the injury or death of
friends, and handling body parts. Examples of firefighter experiences included being trapped and injured in a collapsed
burning building, witnessing the death and/or disfigurement
of others including children and coworkers, and witnessing an
accident scene of a family member. All cases of PTSD were
chronic. Duration of illness ranged from 10 to 35 years. No participant was taking psychotropic or cardiovascular medication at the time of the study. Seven participants (5 in the PTSD
and 2 in the control group) had been taking such medications
before the study but had discontinued them for 2 to 6 weeks,
depending on the type of medication.
The groups did not differ with regard to age (mean ± SD
age, 52.8 ±7.3 [PTSD group] vs 49.7 ±8.9 years [control group];
F1,24 =0.9; P=.35). The control group had an average of 1.8 more
years of education than the PTSD group (mean±SD, 13.8±2.3
[PTSD group] vs 15.6 ± 1.9 years [control group]; F1,24 = 2.2;
P=.04). The groups did not differ in terms of marital status (69%
[PTSD group] vs 85% [control group] married; ␹2⁄1 =0.9; P=.35),
but a greater proportion of participants in the PTSD group were
unemployed (38% [PTSD group] vs 0% [control group]; ␹2⁄1 =6.2;
P=.02). Relative to the control group, the PTSD group had significantly higher mean ± SD scores (indicating greater symptom severity) on the following clinical measures: CAPS
(62.0±25.2 [PTSD group] vs 3.3±6.0 [control group]; F1,22 =61.9;
PϽ.001); the Beck Depression Inventory20 (BDI) (20.7±17.0
[PTSD group] vs 4.2±4.3 [control group]; F1,24 =11.5; P=.003);
and Beck Anxiety Inventory21 (18.8 ± 14.5 [PTSD group] vs
5.0±6.2 [control group]; F1,24 =10.1; P=.004). All symptoms
of PTSD were represented among the various cases of PTSD,
although not every symptom in each case. Flashbacks were less
frequent, and amnesia was rare. The PTSD group’s mean CAPS
score represents moderately severe PTSD symptoms, and the
control group’s mean CAPS score represents minimal PTSD
symptoms.
The presence of other Axis I mental disorders was assessed
with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV.22 Participants in the PTSD group met criteria for the following current
comorbid diagnoses: major depression (n=4), dysthymia (n=2),
bipolar disorder II (n=1), panic disorder (n=3), social phobia
(n=2), and specific phobia (n=1). None of the participants in
the control group met criteria for a current Axis I diagnosis.
This study was approved by the institutional review boards
of the Massachusetts General Hospital and the Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Written informed consent was obtained
from each participant.

STIMULUS PRESENTATION
Stimuli were gray scale images of 6 fearful, 6 happy, and 6 neutral facial expressions selected from a well-validated set.23 Facial expressions were posed by 3 men and 3 women. Each face
was presented for 200 milliseconds, with a 300-millisecond interstimulus interval, in a pseudorandom order such that facial
expressions of a single identity were never presented in succession. Across each run, each fearful and happy face was presented an equal number of times. Subjects viewed 4 runs of these
facial expressions, with each run consisting of ten 28-second
alternating blocks. Each run began and ended with a 28second block of low-level fixation (eg, +NHFHFHFN+). The

order of conditions and runs was counterbalanced across subjects and groups. The paradigm was modeled after those used
in previous studies.8,24 Although it does not permit the acquisition of online behavioral data, we chose to use a passive
viewing paradigm because it has been found to be associated
with relatively robust amygdala responses.25,26 The facial stimuli
were displayed using standardized software (MacStim 2.5.9;
WhiteAnt Occasional Publishing, West Melbourne, Australia)
and an XG-2000V color liquid crystal display projector (Sharp,
Osaka, Japan). Immediately after each scanning session, outside the scanner, participants rated the facial expressions on
scales of valence (negative to positive, −3 to +3) and arousal
(low to high, 0 to 6).

fMRI PROCEDURES
Scans were obtained from a Symphony/Sonata 1.5-T wholebody high-speed imaging device equipped for echo planar imaging (Siemens Medical Systems, Iselin, NJ) with a 3-axis gradient head coil. Head movement was restricted using expandable
foam cushions. After an automated scout image was acquired
and shimming procedures were performed to optimize field homogeneity,27 high-resolution 3-dimensional magnetizationprepared rapid acquisition gradient echo sequences (repetition time/echo time/flip angle, 7.25 milliseconds/3 milliseconds/
7°) with an in-plane resolution of 1.3 mm and 1-mm-slice
thickness were collected for spatial normalization and for positioning the slice prescription of the subsequent sequences.
Then T1- (repetitition time/echo time/flip angle,8 seconds/39
milliseconds/90°) and T2-weighted sequences (repetition time/
echo time/flip angle, 10 seconds/48 milliseconds/120°) were
gathered. Functional MRI images28 were acquired using a gradient echo T2-weighted sequence (repetition time/echo time/
flip angle,2.8 seconds/40 milliseconds/90°). Before each scan,
4 images were acquired and discarded to allow longitudinal magnetization to reach equilibrium. The T1- and T2-weighted and
functional images were collected in the same plane (24 coronal slices angled perpendicular to the anterior commissure–
posterior commissure line) with the same slice thickness (7 mm,
skip 1 mm; voxel size, 3.125ϫ3.125ϫ8 mm), excitation order (interleaved), and phase encoding (foot-to-head).

DATA ANALYSIS
We performed preprocessing and statistical analysis of the fMRI
data using a statistical parametric mapping method (SPM99 software package; Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology,
London, England29). Within SPM99, images were motion corrected (sinc interpolation) and transformed into a standard
(Montreal Neurological Institute [MNI] coordinate system; McGill
University, Montreal, Quebec) stereotactic space (bilinear interpolation). Images were then smoothed with a 4-mm gaussian kernel. At each voxel, the data were fit to a linear statistical
model using the least squares method. The design was modeled
using a boxcar function convolved with the hemodynamic response function. Hypotheses were tested as contrasts in which
linear compounds of the model parameters were evaluated using
t statistics, which were then transformed to z scores.
We chose to focus on the fearful vs happy contrast to facilitate comparison of our present results with those of Rauch
et al.12 The fearful vs neutral contrasts yielded results similar
to those of the fearful vs happy contrasts but will not be discussed further herein for the sake of brevity.
We first computed the voxelwise fearful vs happy contrast
within each group, and then assessed our prediction of exaggerated amygdala responses and diminished medial prefrontal
responses to fearful vs happy facial expressions in PTSD with

(REPRINTED) ARCH GEN PSYCHIATRY/ VOL 62, MAR 2005
275

a voxelwise test of the conditionϫdiagnosis interaction. These
analyses were conducted within the first functional run to avoid
any habituation or sensitization effects. We chose to conduct
the fearful vs happy contrasts within a fixed-effects model because this procedure minimizes type II error. Although fixedeffects analyses limit our ability to generalize from the study
sample to the larger population of patients with PTSD, the present findings in the amygdala presented in the “Results” section) are similar to those of a previous fMRI study.12 Furthermore, random-effects analyses (not shown) revealed similar
(although less robust) findings in the amygdala and medial prefrontal regions.
To determine whether fMRI BOLD signal changes in the
amygdala were significantly related to signal changes in the medial prefrontal cortex in PTSD, we (1) defined a functional region of interest (diameter, 6 mm) around the amygdala activations in run 1 in the PTSD group (MNI coordinates,+22, +4,
−14; +18, −6, −20; and −20, −8, −18), (2) extracted signal values per condition per subject from that region of interest,30 (3)
calculated the fearful vs happy signal change value per subject, and (4) determined whether those change values were associated with signal changes in other brain areas in the fearful
vs happy comparison (using individual subject contrast images) via a voxelwise correlational analysis. To determine the
relationship between PTSD symptom severity (CAPS scores)
and fearful vs happy signal change in the amygdala and medial prefrontal regions in the PTSD group, we conducted voxelwise correlational analyses within SPM99. We chose to focus specifically on the amygdala and medial prefrontal regions
in these correlational analyses. Finally, to examine habituation differences between groups, we compared fearful vs happy
responses in early (run 1) vs late (run 4) functional runs.31,32

STATISTICS
The statistical parametric maps resulting from these analyses
were inspected for activations in our a priori regions of interest. Given our strong, directional hypotheses, we used a significance threshold of PϽ.001, uncorrected (z score, Ն3.09)
for activations in these regions. Because the procedure of correcting P values based on the region size is biased toward finding significance in small structures, we chose to use a constant
significance threshold. For regions about which we had no a
priori prediction, we used a more conservative constant significance threshold of PϽ.00001, uncorrected (z score, Ն4.27).
Ratings data are expressed as mean±SD.
RESULTS

FACIAL EXPRESSION RATINGS
Ratings of valence and arousal were submitted to separate 2 ϫ 3 (diagnosis [PTSD and control] ϫ expression
[fearful, happy, and neutral]) analyses of variance. With
regard to valence, only the main effects of group (F1,24 =9.3;
P =.006) and expression (F2,48 =64.5; PϽ.001) were significant. The PTSD group gave more negative ratings
across all facial expressions than the control group. Post
hoc testing showed significant valence ratings differences among all 3 types of facial expressions: fearful
(−1.8±1.4) vs happy (1.7±1.1) (t25 =9.2; PϽ.001); fearful vs neutral (0.0±0.6) (t25 =6.0; PϽ.001); and neutral
vs happy (t25 =7.7; PϽ.001).
Analysis of the arousal ratings revealed only a significant main effect of expression (F2,46 =17.9; PϽ.001). Post

In the control group, BOLD signal increases occurred in bilateral amygdala, rostral and dorsal anterior
cingulate gyri, and dorsal medial frontal gyrus, as well
as other regions about which we had no specific a priori
hypotheses (Table 1).
The voxelwise condition ϫ diagnosis interaction revealed greater BOLD signal increases in the PTSD group
(or greater decreases in the control group) in the right
amygdala (Figure 1 and Table 2) among other regions. Greater BOLD signal increases in the control group

pattern of results remained when BDI scores were controlled via analysis of covariance and when 4 subjects with
PTSD and comorbid major depressive disorder were removed from the analyses.
Amygdala/Medial Prefrontal Correlations
Within all PTSD participants in the first run, BOLD signal changes in the right amygdala (MNI coordinates,+22, +4, −14) were negatively correlated with BOLD
signal changes in the dorsal medial frontal gyrus (z=3.09;
MNI coordinates, +14, +50, +16) (Figure 3). BOLD signal changes in the more posterior right amygdala activation (MNI coordinates, +18, −6, −20) were negatively
correlated with BOLD signal changes in the dorsal medial frontal gyrus (z = 5.30; MNI coordinates, −10, +50,
+14). Signal changes in the right and left amygdala were
also significantly negatively correlated with ventral medial prefrontal regions; however, the removal of 1 extreme score in each of these latter correlations resulted
in subthreshold (Ͻ3.09) z scores. This pattern of results persisted when subjects with PTSD and comorbid
depression were removed from the analyses. No such significant correlations were observed in the control group.

Symptom Severity Correlations

COMMENT

In the PTSD group, PTSD symptom severity (as measured by the CAPS) was negatively correlated with BOLD
signal changes in the rostral anterior cingulate gyrus
(z=3.62; MNI coordinates, −4, +44, +8) (Figure 4) but
was not significantly correlated with signal changes in
the amygdala. Depression symptom severity in the PTSD
group (as measured by the BDI) was positively correlated with BOLD signal changes in the ventral medial frontal/orbitofrontal gyrus (z = 3.60; MNI coordinates, +14,
+44, −16) and negatively correlated with signal changes
in the right amygdala (z=3.25; MNI coordinates, +28, −4,
−16). Thus, the CAPS and BDI appeared to be related very
differently to BOLD signal changes in our regions of interest.

In the present study, the PTSD group exhibited exaggerated amygdala responses and diminished medial prefrontal cortex responses to overtly presented fearful vs
happy facial expressions. In addition, only in the PTSD
group were BOLD signal changes in the amygdala negatively correlated with signal changes in the medial prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, in the PTSD group, symptom severity was negatively related to BOLD signal
changes in the medial prefrontal cortex. Finally, relative to the control group, the PTSD group tended to exhibit diminished habituation of fearful vs happy responses in the right amygdala over functional runs,
although this effect did not exceed our a priori statistical threshold.
Our finding of relatively greater amygdala responses
in PTSD is consistent with previous research using traumatic reminders1-6 and masked facial expressions.12 Taken
together, the present results and those of Rauch et al12
show that amygdala hyperresponsivity in PTSD can be
demonstrated using facial expression stimuli that are above
or below the threshold of conscious recognition.6
In general, studies using overt facial expressions8,10,24,25,32 have reported BOLD signal changes in a
greater number of brain regions, compared with studies
using masked facial expressions.11,33 Thus, using stimuli
that are above the threshold of conscious recognition
might afford the ability to examine BOLD signal changes
in brain regions other than the amygdala. In the present
study, we report relatively diminished BOLD signal
changes in medial prefrontal regions in PTSD and a negative correlation between symptom severity and BOLD signal changes in the medial prefrontal cortex. These findings are consistent with those of previous functional

Habituation Analyses
In the control group, fearful vs happy responses decreased from run 1 to run 4 in the right amygdala (z=4.33;
MNI coordinates, +18, −6, −18), rostral anterior cingulate gyrus (z=3.18; MNI coordinates, 0, +36, −8), and
medial frontal gyrus (z=3.22; MNI coordinates, −12, +56,
+4). In the PTSD group, fearful vs happy responses decreased from runs 1 to 4 in the amygdala/periamygdaloid cortex (z=3.00; MNI coordinates, +22, +6, −14) and
ventral medial frontal gyrus (z = 3.56; MNI coordinates,
−6, +48, −16; z= 3.25; MNI coordinates, 0, +46, −10).
The decline in fearful vs happy responses in the right
amygdala tended to be greater in the control vs PTSD
group, but did not exceed a priori statistical thresholds
(z=2.08; MNI coordinates, +18, −4, −18; z= 2.04; MNI
coordinates, +26, 0, −16). The decline in fearful vs happy
responses in rostral anterior cingulate gyrus was greater

Fearful vs Happy Response in Right Amygdala

responses in the right amygdala (Montreal Neurological Institute [MNI]

responses in dorsal medial frontal gyrus (z =3.09; MNI coordinates, +14,

neuroimaging studies of PTSD using other types of
stimuli5,13-17 and, along with recent reports of structural
abnormalities in these regions,34-36 further implicate medial prefrontal cortex in the pathophysiology of this disorder.
In the PTSD group, we found that BOLD signal changes
in the amygdala were negatively correlated with signal
changes in the medial frontal gyrus. This finding, which
is similar to one recently reported in the context of a symptom provocation paradigm,5 supports the presence of a
reciprocal relationship between these regions, but cannot offer information regarding the direction of causality. Medial prefrontal regions send projections to the
amygdala in primates,37-40 modulate amygdala output,41
and play an important role in the process of extinction
of fear conditioning.42-44 Conversely, the amygdala may
modulate prefrontal neuronal activity.45 Although the current finding of a reciprocal relationship between the amyg(REPRINTED) ARCH GEN PSYCHIATRY/ VOL 62, MAR 2005
278

dala and medial prefrontal cortex is consistent with that
of a previous report,5 it also differs from the results of a
recent positron emission tomographic symptom provocation study46 in which multivariate structural equation
modeling suggested the possibility of a positive relationship between the amygdala and cingulate/subcallosal cortex blood flow in PTSD. Additional research is needed
to further clarify this issue.
The present and previous studies suggest functional
abnormalities in medial prefrontal regions in PTSD. However, across studies, these functional abnormalities have
differed in location within the medial prefrontal cortex,
including the medial frontal gyrus and anterior cingulate gyrus. However, it is unlikely that all medial prefrontal regions perform a unitary function. Insights regarding the functional differences between various medial
prefrontal regions in humans with PTSD will likely arise
from the findings of future basic science studies of conditioning and extinction.47,48
Analyses of BOLD signal changes from runs 1 to 4 suggested that fearful vs happy responses in the right amygdala decreased in the control group, consistent with the
findings of previous studies of habituation in healthy individuals.31,32,49,50 There was a nonsignificant trend for the
PTSD group to show diminished habituation in the right
amygdala, compared with the control group. However,
we must emphasize that this pattern occurred in only 2
small loci in the right amygdala and that future studies
involving larger numbers of subjects are needed to confirm this finding. If replicated, diminished habituation
of amygdala responses may be seen as broadly consistent with previous findings of slower habituation of psychophysiologic responses to loud tones in PTSD.51-53 Habituation of medial prefrontal cortex responses occurred
in both groups, although it was significantly greater in
the control vs PTSD group in the rostral anterior cingulate gyrus. We attribute this group difference in reWWW.ARCHGENPSYCHIATRY.COM

Figure 4. Correlation of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity (as assessed by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale [CAPS]) with fearful vs
happy responses in the rostral anterior cingulate (AC) gyrus (A; arrow) (z = 3.62; Montreal Neurological Institute [MNI] coordinates, −4, +44, +8) in the PTSD
group. Functional data are superimposed on a standard SPM99 T1 template (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, England). The graph (B)
shows negative correlation of CAPS scores with fearful vs happy responses.

sponse changes over time to a floor effect: the PTSD group
started out (in run 1) with lower rostral anterior cingulate responses compared with the control group, and further decreases were necessarily smaller in magnitude.
Although amygdala responses to fearful vs happy faces
were bilateral within each group, the conditionϫdiagnosis
interaction occurred in the right amygdala. Indeed,
most1,3,12,54,55 but not all2,5 findings of amygdala hyperresponsivity in PTSD have been right-sided. In addition,
correlations between PTSD symptom severity and amygdala activity also have been right-sided.3,5,7 Functional abnormalities in the right amygdala may be associated with
a failure of habituation or of sensitization to emotional
stimuli.56
Exaggerated amygdala responses to fearful facial expressions have been observed in PTSD,12 but not in specific (small-animal) phobia57 or in social phobia.58 Further research on panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive
disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder would be
needed to determine the specificity of these findings to
PTSD vs other anxiety disorders. However, individuals
with social phobia appear to exhibit exaggerated amygdala responses to neutral faces alone,59 as well as to contemptuous and angry faces vs happy faces.58 Thus, whether
exaggerated amygdala activation is demonstrated in a particular disorder may depend on the facial expressions used
and their relevance to the disorder in question. Fearful
faces may be particularly relevant to patients with PTSD,
whereas contemptuous, angry, or even ambiguous neutral faces might be particularly relevant to patients with
social phobia.
Definitive conclusions from the present study are limited by the presence of comorbidity in the PTSD group,
although the key results remained significant even after
controlling for BDI scores and excluding participants with
current major depression. In addition, responsivity of our
regions of interest was related to BDI and CAPS scores
in very different ways, suggesting that depression symptoms cannot explain the main findings. The relatively

small sample size precluded comparisons between firefighters and combat veterans with PTSD. In addition, the
participants in this study were all men; whether the findings can be generalized to women with PTSD remains
to be determined. Finally, as with any passive viewing
paradigm, behavioral data could not be collected or compared between groups.
CONCLUSIONS

The present results are consistent with exaggerated amygdala responsivity, diminished medial prefrontal cortex
responsivity, and a reciprocal relationship between these
2 regions in PTSD. Additional studies are needed to confirm the finding of diminished habituation of amygdala
responses over repeated fearful vs happy facial expressions in PTSD, and to determine whether such habituation abnormalities occur in response to other types of
stimuli.
