Background: Several recent neuroimaging studies have
examined the neuroanatomical correlates of normal emotional states, such as happiness, sadness, fear, anger,
anxiety, and disgust; however, no previous study has
examined the emotional state of guilt.
Methods: In the current study, we used positron emission
tomography and the script-driven imagery paradigm to
study regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) during the
transient emotional experience of guilt in eight healthy
male participants. In the Guilt condition, participants
recalled and imagined participating in a personal event
involving the most guilt they had ever experienced. In the
Neutral condition, participants recalled and imagined
participating in an emotionally neutral personal event.
Results: In the Guilt versus Neutral comparison, rCBF
increases occurred in anterior paralimbic regions of the
brain: bilateral anterior temporal poles, anterior cingulate gyrus, and left anterior insular cortex/inferior frontal
gyrus.
Conclusions: These results, along with those of previous
studies, are consistent with the notion that anterior paralimbic regions of the brain mediate negative emotional
states in healthy individuals. Biol Psychiatry 2000;48:

and negative emotional states in healthy participants (e.g.,

Paradiso et al 1997; Pardo et al 1993; Reiman et al 1997;
Schneider et al 1995, 1997). These studies, which have
included conditions of happiness, sadness, fear, anger,
anxiety, and disgust, typically report increased activation
in limbic and paralimbic regions of the brain, especially
during negative emotional states. These findings are consistent with the notion that limbic and paralimbic regions
of the brain mediate emotional states and the processing of
information with affective significance (e.g., LeDoux
1992; Mesulam 1985). For example, George et al (1996)
used positron emission tomography (PET) to study regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) during transient sadness
and happiness in healthy males and females. In separate
scanning conditions, participants recalled neutral, sad, and
happy events while they viewed affect-appropriate faces
and attempted to experience the emotion corresponding to
each facial expression. In the Sad versus Neutral comparison, participants exhibited blood flow increases in left
insular cortex, and female participants showed additional
blood flow increases in anterior cingulate gyrus.
Lane et al (1997b) used PET to examine rCBF during
happiness, sadness, and disgust versus neutral states in
healthy females. In separate scans, each of these states was
induced via a film clip (Film Condition) and script-driven
recall (Recall Condition). Within the Recall Condition
only, rCBF increases during sadness occurred in insular
cortex. Within the Film Condition only, rCBF increases
during sadness occurred in bilateral amygdala. In both
conditions combined, all three emotional states were
associated with rCBF increases in anterior temporal poles.
Guilt is a negative emotion that has not been studied
with neuroimaging techniques. Usually associated with the
belief that one has harmed another person (Frijda 1994),
guilt is a complex emotion, and situations that provoke
guilt may also provoke other negative emotions. Furthermore, whether guilt is associated with a particular pattern
of psychophysiological changes is not known (Levenson
1994). Despite these difficulties, the emotional state of
guilt merits investigation because of its prevalence in
healthy individuals and in patients with psychiatric disorders, such as depression and posttraumatic stress disorder
(e.g., Berrios et al 1992; Henning and Frueh 1997).

In the current study, we used PET and the script-driven
imagery paradigm (Lang 1985; Lang et al 1983; Pitman et
al 1987; Rauch et al 1996; Shin et al 1999) to study the
neural correlates of transient emotional experiences of
guilt in eight healthy male volunteers. In the script-driven
imagery paradigm, participants are presented with audiotaped descriptions of personal events and are asked to
recall and imagine those events and their related emotions
as vividly as possible. During script-driven imagery, we
measured participants’ peripheral psychophysiologic responses (heart rate, skin conductance, and lateral frontalis
electromyogram [EMG]), as well as rCBF. We sought to
examine rCBF changes in the Guilt condition, relative to
the Neutral condition. Given the results of previous studies
of negative emotional states in both healthy individuals
and patients with psychiatric disorders (e.g., George et al
1996; Lane et al 1997a, 1997b; Rauch et al 1994, 1995,
1996; Shin et al 1999), we predicted that rCBF increases
in the Guilt versus Neutral comparison would occur in
anterior paralimbic regions of the brain (i.e., orbitofrontal
cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus, anterior insular cortex,
anterior temporal poles) and amygdala. We had no specific
predictions about rCBF decreases in the Guilt condition.

Methods and Materials
Participants
Participants were eight healthy, right-handed (Oldfield 1971)
men with a mean age of 25.0 years (SD ϭ 4.4) and mean
education of 15.9 years (SD ϭ 3.6). Participants had no history
of psychiatric disorders (as determined by the Structured Clinical
Interview for DSM-IIIR; Spitzer et al 1990), neurological disorders, head injury, or other major medical conditions. In addition,
no participant was taking psychotropic or cardiovascular medication. The study was approved by the Subcommittee on Human
Studies of the Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, and
the Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Manchester, NH. Written
informed consent was obtained from each participant.

Scripts
Prior to the PET scanning session, participants provided written
descriptions of personal events: one involving the most guilt the
participant had ever experienced, and two additional events
involving no prominent emotion. These descriptions were then
modified according to established procedures (Lang et al 1983;
Pitman et al 1987, 1990; Rauch et al 1996; Shin et al 1999) and
were written in the second person, present tense. Scripts were
read and tape-recorded in a neutral male voice for playback in the
PET scanner. All scripts were between 30 and 40 sec in duration.

Measures
PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY. Participants’ heart rate, skin conductance, and left lateral frontalis electromyograms (EMG) were

measured via a Coulbourn Instruments (Allentown, PA) Modular
Instrument System in the PET laboratory according to established procedures (Orr et al 1998; Pitman et al 1987, 1990).
Psychophysiologic measurements were recorded for 30 sec
before each PET scan (baseline), and for 60 sec during each PET
scan (imagery). Within the baseline and imagery periods (for
each scan), readings were averaged. For each scan, the mean
value of the baseline period was subtracted from the mean value
of the imagery period, yielding “response” (i.e., change) scores.
SUBJECTIVE RATINGS. After each scan, participants rated
the intensity of several emotions using separate visual analog
scales (Pitman et al 1987, 1990; Rauch et al 1996; Shin et al
1999; 0 ϭ absent; 10 ϭ maximal). The rated emotions included
guilt, shame, sadness, disgust, anger, fear, surprise, happiness,
general arousal, competitive arousal, and sexual arousal. Participants also rated the overall valence (Ϫ5 to ϩ5) of their
emotional state during each scan.

State Induction/Imagery Procedure
Participants underwent PET scanning in two conditions: Guilt
(one scan) and Neutral (two scans, with two different scripts).
(Participants also underwent scanning in three other conditions
[anger, competitive arousal, and sexual arousal] as part of a
larger study; however, those other conditions are not relevant to
the current results and are presented elsewhere; see Dougherty et
al 1999; Rauch et al 1999.) During each scan, participants
recalled and imagined the contents of a single script. The neutral
scans always occurred first and last; the order of the remaining
scans (one Guilt and three other scans not reported here) were
completely counterbalanced in a Latin Square design.
Immediately before each scan, participants were instructed to
close their eyes, listen carefully to the audiotaped script, and
imagine the described event as vividly as possible, as if they were
actually participating in the event again. The script started
playing and the PET camera was turned on when there were 30
sec left in the script. At the end of the script, 15O-CO2
administration began. During the next 60 sec, participants continued to recall and imagine the event while PET and peripheral
psychophysiologic data were acquired. Then 15O-CO2 administration and PET data acquisition were terminated, and participants were instructed to stop imagining the event and to relax.
Thirty sec later, participants gave ratings of their emotional
experiences during the preceding scan. PET scans were separated
by at least 10 min in order to allow for radiation decay and a
return to a baseline emotional state.

PET
PROCEDURES. The PET equipment and procedures have
been described previously (Rauch et al 1996; Shin et al 1997,
1999). Briefly, PET data were gathered by a 15-slice, wholebody tomograph (Scanditronix PC 4096, General Electric, Milwaukee). The camera produced contiguous slices 6.5 mm apart,
with axial resolution at 6.0 mm full-width half maximum
(FWHM; axial field, 97.5 mm). Images were reconstructed using
a measured attenuation correction and a Hanning-weighted

PET Study of Guilt

reconstruction filter set to allow for 8-mm in-plane spatial
resolution (FWHM).
After entering the scanner, each participant was fitted with a
thermoplastic custom-molded face mask, an overlying face mask
attached to a vacuum, and nasal cannulae which delivered the
15
O-CO2. The concentration of the 15O-CO2 was 2960 MBq/L;
the flow rate was 2 L/min. Each participant’s head was aligned
in the scanner relative to the canthomeatal line, and transmission
measurements were made using an orbiting pin source.
A total of 15 measurements were made within each data
acquisition run: the first three (10 sec each) occurred immediately prior to 15O-CO2 administration, and the final 12 (5 sec
each) occurred during 15O-CO2 administration. After reconstruction, measurements 4 –15 were summed to form images of
cerebral blood flow. Terminal count rates were between 100,000
and 200,000 events/sec.
The PET images were corrected for interscan head movement
and were transformed to the standard coordinate system of
Talairach and Tournoux (1988). The images were smoothed and
scaled using a two-dimensional Gaussian filter of 20-mm width
(FWHM).

Guilt and Neutral Conditions

DATA ANALYSIS. Statistical analysis of the PET data was
conducted using the SPM95 software package (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London) which follows the
theory of statistical parametric mapping (Friston et al 1991,
1995). At each voxel the PET data were normalized by the global
mean and fit to a linear statistical model by the method of least
squares. The analysis of variance considered Scan Condition as
the main effect and Participants as a block effect. Planned
contrasts at each voxel were conducted; this method fits a linear
statistical model, voxel-by-voxel, to the data. Hypotheses were
tested as contrasts in which linear compounds of the model
parameters were evaluated using t statistics. Data from both
conditions (Guilt and Neutral) were used to compute the contrast
error term.
Regions containing foci of activation with Z scores greater
than 3.09 are reported. For our a priori regions of interest, a Z
score threshold of 3.09 (p Ͻ .001, one-tailed, uncorrected for
multiple comparisons) was selected, because we had strong and
directional a priori predictions about rCBF increases in limbic
and paralimbic regions of the brain in the Guilt versus Neutral
comparison. These predictions were based on the results of
previous neuroimaging studies of other normal emotional states
(e.g., George et al 1995, 1996; Lane et al 1997a, 1997b; Pardo et
al 1993; Reiman et al 1997). For the sake of completeness and in
order to obviate bias, we also report other (nonpredicted) regions
that exhibited rCBF increases with Z scores greater than 3.09,
although we advise the reader to use caution in interpreting them
given their post-hoc nature.

PET Results
In the Guilt versus Neutral comparison, rCBF increases
occurred in three of our paralimbic regions of interest:
bilateral anterior temporal poles, anterior cingulate gyrus,
and left anterior insular cortex/inferior frontal cortex (see
Table 2 and Figure 1). No rCBF increases (or decreases)
were observed in amygdala. rCBF increases occurred in
the following other areas: mid-cingulate gyrus, cerebellum, and left precentral gyrus. rCBF decreases occurred in
left posterior insular cortex, visual association cortex, right
precuneus, left fusiform gyrus, and right precentral gyrus.

Discussion
Relative to the Neutral condition, the Guilt condition was
associated with rCBF increases in three of our paralimbic
regions of interest: bilateral anterior temporal poles, anterior cingulate gyrus, and left anterior insular cortex/
inferior frontal cortex. rCBF decreases occurred in more
posterior portions of left insular cortex. These findings are
generally consistent with those of previous studies of
normal emotional states.
Studies of nonhuman primates have revealed direct
connections from anterior temporal poles to the amygdala
(Aggleton et al 1980). In addition, electrical stimulation of
anterior temporal poles can elicit autonomic responses in
monkeys and cats (Anand and Dua 1956; Kaada et al
1949) and reports of fear and nervousness in humans
(Mullan and Penfield 1959). Activation in anterior tempo-

ral poles has been reported in other studies of normal
emotion (e.g., Lane et al 1997a, 1997b; Kimbrell et al
1999; Reiman et al 1997), as well as in studies of patients
with anxiety disorders (Rauch et al 1995, 1996; Shin et al
1999). In two previous studies of anxiety, rCBF increases
in temporal poles were attributed to extracranial artifacts
of jaw muscle contraction (Drevets et al 1992; Benkelfat et
al 1995); however, the temporopolar activations reported
in the current study were clearly within brain. Although
activation in anterior temporal poles has largely been
associated with negative emotional states, at least one
study has reported these types of activations during filmand recall-generated happiness (Lane et al 1997b). Thus,
the anterior temporal poles may be involved in information processing of emotional material, possibly regardless
of valence.
The cingulate gyrus is a large structure that appears to
have different functional subdivisions (Devinsky et al
1995; Vogt et al 1992, 1995). The activation reported in
the present study is located in a region of the anterior
cingulate gyrus (approximately Brodmann area 32) that
lies just superior to the genu of the corpus callosum,
approximately 24 mm above the anterior commissure–
posterior commissure (AC–PC) plane. This region may
correspond to superior portions of the affective division of
the anterior cingulate gyrus (ACad), which lies inferior to
the dorsal region of the anterior cingulate that is thought to
principally mediate cognitive processes (e.g., Bush et al
1998; Pardo et al 1990; see Vogt et al 1992, 1995), and
superior to the portion of the anterior cingulate that is
thought to mediate visceral functions (Vogt et al 1992,
1995). Activations in this vicinity (roughly 10 –24 mm
above the AC–PC plane) have also been reported in
studies involving procaine-induced fear (Ketter et al 1996;
Servan-Schreiber et al 1998), the recollection of traumatic
events in trauma-exposed healthy individuals (Shin et al
1999), the performance of the emotional Stroop task
(Whalen et al 1998a), the prediction of treatment response
in depression (Mayberg et al 1997), and symptom provocation in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder
(Rauch et al 1994).
In the current study, the Guilt condition was associated
with rCBF increases in anterior insular cortex/inferior
frontal gyrus and rCBF decreases in more posterior regions of insular cortex. Anterior and posterior portions of
insular cortex appear to differ considerably in terms of
cellular organization, connections with other brain regions, and function (Mesulam and Mufson 1982a, 1982b;
Mufson and Mesulam 1982). Anterior insular cortex
contains agranular and dysgranular cells, shares extensive
connections with other anterior paralimbic regions and the
amygdala (Aggleton et al 1980), and is involved in
olfactory, gustatory, and autonomic function (Mesulam

and Mufson 1982b; Small et al 1999). Electrical stimulation of anterior insular cortex is associated with reports of
fear in humans (Mullan and Penfield 1959), and activation
of anterior insular cortex has occurred during symptom
provocation in patients with phobias (Rauch et al 1995),
the recollection of negative events in healthy individuals
(George et al 1996; Shin et al 1999), procaine-induced fear
(Ketter et al 1996; Servan-Schreiber et al 1998), the
perception of facial expressions of disgust (Phillips et al
1997), imagery of aversive stimuli (Kosslyn et al 1996),
and aversive gustatory stimulation (Zald et al 1998). In
contrast, posterior insular cortex contains granular cells,
shares connections with superior temporal, parietal, premotor, and somatosensory cortex, and is involved in the
processing of auditory and somatosensory information
(Coghill et al 1994; Francis et al 1999; Mesulam and
Mufson 1982a, 1982b; Mufson and Mesulam 1982;
Schneider et al 1993). Activation in anterior insular cortex
during the emotional state of guilt is consistent with theory
and data regarding the role that this region may play in the
processing of emotional information. Deactivation in more
posterior regions of insular cortex during the Guilt condition was unexpected, but could reflect a reallocation of

blood flow toward more anterior regions of insular cortex
during a negative emotional state.
No activation occurred in the amygdala or orbitofrontal
cortex during the Guilt condition in this study. Indeed, the
amygdala may be more involved in fear and the processing
of fear-related stimuli (e.g., LaBar et al 1998; Morris et al
1996; Rauch et al 1996; Whalen et al 1998b). In addition,
in healthy individuals, the amygdala may be more responsive during conditions involving the perception of emotional stimuli than the recollection and imagery of those
stimuli (Reiman et al 1997; Whalen 1998). Furthermore,
the limited spatial and temporal resolution of PET may
have hindered our ability to detect activation in the
amygdala. The absence of activation in orbitofrontal
cortex in this study was somewhat surprising, given
previous reports of orbitofrontal activation during negative
emotional states in healthy humans (e.g., Fischer et al
1996; Paradiso et al 1997; Pardo et al 1993; Zald et al
1998).
Possible limitations of this study include the modest
sample size, the lack of behavioral measures, and the
dependence on self-report data. In addition, one might
argue that the absence of significant peripheral psycho-

48

BIOL PSYCHIATRY

physiologic changes between the Guilt and Neutral conditions was a limitation. To our knowledge, however, there
is no evidence that the emotional state of guilt is accompanied by such changes. Furthermore, although great care
was taken to match the conditions as closely as possible on
a number of different variables (such as script length,
tense, voice), the conditions may have differed in more
subtle ways. For example, although the Guilt condition
was indeed marked by high subjective ratings of guilt, it
was also accompanied by moderate ratings of related
emotions, especially shame and sadness. Anxiety, which
has been associated with paralimbic activation (e.g., Chua
et al 1999; Cottraux et al 1996; Kimbrell et al 1999; Rauch
et al 1994, 1995, 1996; Shin et al 1997, 1999), also may
have occurred in the Guilt condition, although the lack of
peripheral psychophysiologic changes during the Guilt
condition may not be consistent with this possibility. In
short, activations in the Guilt versus Neutral comparison
may have reflected changes in other related emotions as
well. Finally, PET studies in general are limited by errors
in precise neuroanatomical localization that can arise from
constraints set by the spatial resolution of PET, unavoidable head movement, or stereotaxic transformation. In
addition, normalizing whole-brain blood flow prevented
us from detecting any absolute blood flow changes between conditions.
In conclusion, the Guilt condition was associated with
rCBF increases in bilateral anterior temporal poles, anterior cingulate gyrus, and left anterior insular cortex/
inferior frontal cortex and rCBF decreases in more posterior portions of left insular cortex. The results of this and
other similar studies are consistent with the notion that
anterior paralimbic regions of the brain mediate negative
emotional states in healthy individuals and are involved in
the processing of information with affective significance.
