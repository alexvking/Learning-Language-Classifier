Abstract
Background: Previous research suggests that individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) preferentially
attend to trauma-related emotional stimuli and have difficulty completing unrelated concurrent tasks. Compared to
trauma-exposed control groups, individuals with PTSD also exhibit lower rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC)
activation during tasks involving interference from trauma-related stimuli. However, it is not clear whether relatively
diminished rACC activation in PTSD also occurs during interference tasks involving trauma-unrelated emotional
stimuli. The present study employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and an interference task that
involves emotional facial expressions and elicits rACC activation in healthy participants.
Findings: While performing a trauma-unrelated emotional interference task, participants with PTSD (n=17) showed
less rACC activation than trauma-exposed non-PTSD (TENP; n=18) participants. In the PTSD group, rACC activation
was negatively correlated with the severity of re-experiencing symptoms. The two groups did not significantly differ
on behavioral measures (i.e., response times and error rates).
Conclusions: These findings suggest that relatively diminished rACC activation in PTSD can be observed in
interference tasks involving trauma-unrelated emotional stimuli, indicating a more general functional brain
abnormality in this disorder. Future neuroimaging studies need not employ trauma-related stimuli in order to
detect rACC abnormalities in PTSD.

Background
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating
psychiatric disorder that occurs in 9-20% of individuals
following a traumatic event [1]. Those with PTSD have
difficulty suppressing trauma-related thoughts and suffer
from persistent re-experiencing symptoms [2,3]. Such
symptoms have been studied in the laboratory with
interference tasks in which participants are asked to
ignore trauma-related information (e.g., words) while
performing an unrelated cognitive task (such as naming
the color or number of the words). Indeed, individuals
with PTSD have difficulty performing such tasks and

show impaired behavioral performance (e.g. [3-5]) and
relatively diminished activation in the rostral anterior
cingulate cortex (rACC) [6,7]. The rACC is a brain
structure that is thought to resolve emotional conflict
[8] and/or “decrease the ‘weighting’ of affective information in the service of optimizing cognitive performance”
[9]. Relatively diminished rACC function in PTSD may
reflect a failure to (1) appropriately “weight” distracting
emotional information and (2) inhibit the amygdala
(e.g. [10]). In fact, activation of the rACC has been
found to negatively correlate with PTSD symptom
severity (e.g. [11,12]).
Previous neuroimaging studies that found reduced
rACC activation in PTSD during interference tasks have
used trauma-related words as stimuli [6,7]. If the same
rACC abnormality could be demonstrated using trauma-

unrelated emotional stimuli, it would suggest the presence
of a more global emotional and attentional dysfunction in
PTSD, as opposed to a deficit specific to trauma-related
stimuli. Two recent studies examined rACC activation
in participants with PTSD during trauma-unrelated
emotional interference [13,14] but yielded conflicting
results.
In the current experiment, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study rACC activation in individuals with PTSD and trauma-exposed
non-PTSD (TENP) participants during the performance of an interference task using trauma-unrelated
emotional stimuli (i.e., faces and words) [8,15]. We hypothesized that the PTSD group would exhibit diminished
rACC activation relative to the TENP group when comparing high-interference to low-interference conditions.
Given previous findings (e.g., [11-13]), we also hypothesized that, for the PTSD group only, rACC activation
would inversely correlate with PTSD symptom severity.

Methods
We recruited 42 right-handed participants who had been
exposed to criterion A traumatic events (e.g., assault,
motor vehicle accidents, abuse, and witnessing serious
injury/death). Of these, 21 had current PTSD and 21
never developed PTSD. Within the PTSD group, two
participants were removed due to excessive movement
during the scan, one participant stopped the scan before
the task began, and one participant failed to respond to
an adequate number (75%) of trials. Within the TENP
group, two participants were excluded due to a button
box malfunction, and one participant was excluded due
to excessive errors (greater than 25%). A total of 17
PTSD (14 female) and 18 TENP (13 female) participants
were included in the final analyses.
PTSD diagnoses were determined using the Clinician
Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) [16]. All other diagnoses were made using the Structured Clinical Interview
for the DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID) [2]. Participants
were free of the following: contraindications to MRI
(e.g., metallic implants), complicating major medical
conditions such as neurological disorders, pregnancy,
current use of psychotropic medications, and a history
of drug/alcohol abuse in the last six months. None of
the TENP participants met criteria for any psychiatric
disorders. Some participants with PTSD were also
diagnosed with current major depressive disorder
(MDD; n=5), specific phobia (n=1), and panic disorder
(n=3). Psychometric and clinical data are presented in
Table 1. All participants provided written informed
consent. This study was in compliance with the
Helsinki Declaration and approved by the institutional
review board at Partners Healthcare System, Boston,
Massachusetts.

Stimuli and procedures

Stimuli consisted of black and white photographs of 10
faces (5 male), each displaying one happy and one fearful
expression [19], with either the word “happy” or “afraid”
superimposed on each face (Figure 1). In the Congruent
condition (low-interference), the superimposed word
matched the facial expression. In the Incongruent condition (high-interference), the superimposed word did not
match the facial expression. In the Baseline condition, a
string of Xs was superimposed on the facial expression.
Presentation timing was jittered using Optseq [20]. Faces
were presented for 1300 milliseconds (ms), with a 700
ms inter-stimulus interval, in a pseudorandom order
such that the same identity was never presented in succession. Fearful and happy faces were presented an equal
number of times for a total of 180 stimuli per run. Interleaved within the facial stimuli were 28 white fixation
crosses (null trials), which were presented for either
1300 ms or 3300 ms.
Participants completed four runs (6 minutes and 40
seconds each), but fMRI (and behavioral) analyses
included only the first two runs to avoid decrements in

trial, in which the word matched the facial expression. The face

anterior cingulate activation that are known to occur
with extended task performance [21]. Face stimuli were
displayed using MacStim Carbon 3.2.1 and projected
via a Sharp Notevision6 (XG-NV6XU) LCD projector
(Osaka, Japan). Participants used a button box to indicate whether faces were happy or afraid. Button assignments for “happy” and “afraid” were counterbalanced
across subjects.
Image acquisition

Participants were scanned using a Symphony/Sonata
1.5T whole body high-speed imaging device, equipped
for echo planar imaging (Siemens Medical Systems,
Iselin, NJ) with a 3-axis gradient head coil. First, we
collected an automated scout image and shimmed
[22]. Next, we collected two high-resolution threedimensional magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequences (TR/TE/Flip
angle=2730 ms/3.39 ms/7°) with 1.33 mm slice thickness. We acquired fMRI blood-oxygen-level dependent
(BOLD) signal images [23] using gradient echo T2*weighted sequences (TR/TE/Flip angle=2000 ms/40 ms/
90°) in 22 coronal slices, (thickness=7 mm, 1 mm gap),
with interleaved excitation order and foot-to-head phase
encoding. To allow longitudinal magnetization to reach
equilibrium, four images were acquired and discarded before the start of each functional scan.
Data analysis
Behavioral analyses

Response times were averaged across correct trials within
each condition. Separate 2 (Group: PTSD, TENP) × 2
(Condition: Incongruent, Congruent) analyses of variance
(ANOVA) were used to analyze response time and error
rate data. With regard to error rates, we examined both
errors of commission (incorrect response) and errors of
omission (failure to respond) in separate ANOVAs.

Neurological Institute [MNI] template), and smoothed
with a Gaussian filter set at 7mm full width at half
maximum.
Voxelwise Incongruent vs. Congruent (IvC) contrast
images were created for each participant. These contrast
images were then submitted to a second-level random
effects model to assess differences between groups
(PTSD vs. TENP). Trials involving either errors of commission or omission were excluded from all contrasts.
Statistical parametric maps were inspected for activations
in rACC and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) that
exceeded a significance threshold of p<0.001 (one-tailed),
uncorrected. We included the dACC as a secondary region
of interest because previous studies have shown relatively
greater dACC activation in PTSD versus non-PTSD groups
(e.g., [6,14,24,25]). Consistent with previous research, the
rACC was defined as the region superior/anterior to the
corpus callosum and inferior to the cingulate sulcus, with
a y coordinate greater than +30 [26]. The dACC was
defined as the region superior to the corpus callosum and
inferior to the cingulate sulcus, with a y coordinate between 0 and +30 [25-27]. Activations observed outside of
these predefined regions of interest (ROIs) were subjected
to the more conservative threshold of p<0.00001, uncorrected. Data from clusters exceeding these thresholds were
extracted using MarsBaR (MRC Cognition and Brain
Sciences Unit, Cambridge, United Kingdom).
Voxelwise whole brain correlations

To assess the relationship between current CAPS scores
and IvC signal change in the PTSD group, we conducted

the following voxelwise whole brain correlational analyses.
First, we computed the IvC contrast within each
participant in the PTSD group and correlated those
contrast images with total CAPS scores. Because IvC
activation could be related differently to different types
of PTSD symptoms, we also ran correlations with
CAPS-B (re-experiencing), CAPS-C (avoidance/numbing)
and CAPS-D (hyper-arousal) subscale scores. We then
inspected our regions of interest for significant clusters
using the same p-value thresholds as described above.

Findings
Significant main effects of Condition confirmed that response times and error rates were greater in the Incongruent vs. Congruent condition (Table 2). However,
groups did not significantly differ on response time or
error rate measures (ps > 0.32). Only the TENP group
exhibited significant rACC activation in the IvC contrast
(Table 3). When directly compared to the PTSD
group, the TENP group exhibited significantly greater
rACC activation (MNI x,y,z coordinates = 18, 32, 32)
(Table 4). We extracted data from all significant voxels
greater than z=3.09 (p<0.001) in this region for each
condition compared to the null trials (i.e., fixation
crosses). From these extractions, the TENP group
exhibited activation during the Incongruent trials and
deactivation during the Congruent trials. Comparatively,

the participants of the PTSD group did not show such
modulation of activation in the rACC (Figure 2). We
also correlated the extracted data from the rACC (18,
32, 32) with symptom severity scores. Within the PTSD
group, rACC activation was significantly negatively
correlated with CAPS-B subscale scores (r [15]= −0.55,
p=0.03) and had a trend-level negative correlation with
total CAPS (r [15]= −0.44, p=0.08), but was not significantly correlated with other CAPS subscale scores, BAI
scores, or BDI scores (all ps > 0.13). Within the TENP
group, rACC activation did not significantly correlate
with total CAPS scores, CAPS subscale scores, BAI
scores, or BDI scores (all ps > 0.31).
Voxelwise correlation analyses revealed no significant
negative correlation between total CAPS score and
rACC activation (IvC) in the PTSD group; however, we
did find a significant negative correlation between total
CAPS scores and activation of medial frontal gyrus
(MFG), just adjacent to the rACC (MNI x,y,z coordinates = −18, 48, 14; z=3.66; Figure 3A), and activation
in a more dorsal region of the anterior cingulate cortex
(dACC) (MNI x,y,z coordinates = −8, 24, 28; z=3.74;
Figure 3B). We also ran voxelwise correlations between
IvC and CAPS-B, C and D subscale scores in the PTSD
group. The results were similar to those of the correlations with total CAPS scores with one important exception: only CAPS-B (re-experiencing) subscale scores
were significantly negatively correlated with activation
in the rACC proper (MNI x,y,z coordinates = 16, 36, 30;
z=3.28 and 4, 40, 0; z=3.28; Figure 3C and D).

Discussion and conclusion
In support of our primary hypothesis, the PTSD group
exhibited lower rACC activation to trauma-unrelated

interference, as compared to the TENP group. These
results are consistent with those of Kim and colleagues
[13] and suggest that diminished rACC function may reflect a more general abnormality in processing emotional
material in PTSD.

We did not find any significant between-group differences on response times or error rates. It is possible that
rACC dysfunction in PTSD is not behaviorally apparent
until stimuli are more salient (trauma-related). Indeed, a
recent meta-analysis has suggested that trauma-unrelated
emotional word stimuli do not elicit greater behavioral
interference in PTSD participants, as compared to controls
[28]. However, previous studies that used trauma-related
stimuli also failed to find significant behavioral impairment
despite showing diminished rACC activation in PTSD [6,7].
It should be noted, however, that the latter study measured
only accuracy (not response times) and the former study
did report greater group differences in behavioral interference than the current study. Thus, it remains possible that
behavioral evidence of rACC dysfunction is stronger when
the stimuli are more salient. Regardless, the lack of behavioral differences in the present study suggests that our neuroimaging results cannot be attributed to group differences
in behavioral performance.
Consistent with previous research, we found a trend toward a negative correlation between total symptom severity and activation in the rACC proper [11-13]. We also
found significant negative correlations between total
symptom severity and activation of structures adjacent to
the rACC: the MFG and the dACC. Previous studies have
revealed negative correlations between symptom severity
and MFG activation (e.g., [29,30]). The observed dACC
cluster lies 6mm away from the rACC boundary as defined
herein. Given the smoothing kernel (7 mm), this cluster
could reflect function of the rACC. Importantly, we also
found that only re-experiencing symptom severity (CAPSB) was significantly negatively correlated with activation in
rACC proper. That the degree of diminished rACC activation during emotional interference may reflect the severity
of re-experiencing symptoms per se makes sense given
that emotional interference tasks were originally intended
to tap into the cognitive processes underlying reexperiencing symptoms of PTSD [3].
If the rACC deficit in PTSD is more general (i.e., not
specific to trauma-related material), then rACC activation
to emotional interference should correlate negatively with
PTSD symptom severity regardless of whether the emotional stimuli are trauma-related. Consistent with this
hypothesis, Kim et al. [13] found that rACC activation
to trauma-unrelated emotional stimuli is negatively
correlated with PTSD symptom severity. In addition, we
found a similar negative correlation in the current study
between rACC activation and CAPS-B re-experiencing
symptoms. Unfortunately, correlations between brain
activation and symptom severity were not reported in
other previous neuroimaging studies of emotional interference in PTSD [6,7,14].
In summary, our findings suggest that relatively diminished rACC function in PTSD may reflect a more

Offringa et al. Biology of Mood & Anxiety Disorders 2013, 3:10

generalized abnormality that can be observed even
when emotional stimuli are unrelated to trauma. This
finding also has implications for the planning of future
neuroimaging studies that examine rACC function in
groups with diverse trauma histories. Individually tailoring stimuli to match each participant’s traumatic
event may not be necessary as emotional interference
tasks need not contain trauma-related stimuli in order
to reveal rACC abnormalities in PTSD.
