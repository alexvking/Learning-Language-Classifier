Why do Black=White workers earn wages similar to Black workers ($6.30 less per hour
than White workers), despite encountering less negative, anti-Black sentiment from
others? We propose that Black=White workers must contend with stereotypes suggesting
that biracial people are socially unskilled. In the present study we observed that, regardless of whether job candidates were rejected for external reasons (interviewer prejudice)
or whether candidates acted in undesirable ways (claimed discrimination), participants
rated Black=White applicants as less socially skilled and as more likely to have demonstrated poor interview skills than Black applicants. Implications for biases against hiring
biracial people are discussed.

For the United States to meet the competitive demands
of modern industry, it is crucial that employers empower
both White and minority employees to be productive and
successful in the workplace. Nevertheless, wage discrepancies between White and minority workers continue
to exist (U.S. Census Bureau, 2001). Researchers have
identiﬁed social factors, such as race-based discrimination, as contributing to these income disparities
(Clark, Anderson, Clark, & Williams, 1999). Since
2000, when Americans were ﬁrst able to identify with
multiple racial groups on the census, wage discrepancies
have also been found to exist between White and biracial
Americans (U.S. Census Bureau, 2001). Speciﬁcally, census data reveal that biracial men of Black and White
racial heritages (i.e., Black=White) report earning, on
average, $6.30 less per hour than White men.1 This wage
gap is statistically similar to the wage gap dividing White
and Black male workers, and research shows that Black=
White Americans report incomes commensurate with
Black Americans (Fairlie, 2009).
It is not the case, however, that Black=White and
Black people encounter equal amounts of anti-Black sentiment. Indeed, research shows that people expect Black=
White individuals to have lighter skin than individuals

described as having only Black ancestry (Sanchez, Good,
& Chavez, 2011). Light-skinned people, furthermore,
are less likely than their dark-skinned counterparts to
be perceived in terms of negative Black stereotypes
(Maddox, 2004; Maddox & Gray, 2002). Given, then,
that Black=White Americans may escape some of the
negative, anti-Black sentiments that Black Americans
face daily, how can research explain census data showing
that Black=White and Black workers earn similarly
low wages?
According to Fairlie (2009), the assumption that
Black=White people are treated less favorably than
White people, but more favorably than Black people,
implies that Black=White workers should earn signiﬁcantly more than Black workers. Census data do not
support this prediction and show, instead, that Black
and Black=White workers earn similar wages. We propose that, despite facing less anti-Black stereotyping than
monoracial Black people, Black=White workers encounter prejudice based on biracial stereotypes that Black
people do not face and that contribute to the disparate
treatment of White and Black=White individuals. Perceivers stereotypically assume that biracial people are
socially awkward and maladjusted (Chelsey & Wagner,
2003; Jackman, Wagner, & Johnson, 2001; Sanchez &
Bonam, 2009) because they are rejected by both majority
and minority groups in society (Shih & Sanchez, 2005).
Such stereotypical inferences likely affect how Black=
White people are perceived in workplace environments

and particularly in interview settings, given that initial
rapport-building predicts hiring decisions and employment outcomes (Barrick, Swider, & Stewart, 2010).

STEREOTYPES ABOUT BIRACIAL PEOPLE
Do stereotypes about poor social skills characterize perceptions of Black=White job applicants? In other words,
are perceivers more likely to infer that a job applicant has
poor social skills if the applicant is Black=White as
opposed to Black? Research has yet to examine this
possibility despite evidence that widespread immigration
and the increased acceptability of interracial relationships has resulted in a rising number of Americans who
identify themselves as mixed-race (Shih & Sanchez,
2009). Indeed, biracial people are currently recognized
as one of the fastest growing minority groups in the
United States (Shih & Sanchez, 2009) and are projected
to account for approximately 21% of the American
population by the year 2050 (Smith & Edmonston,
1997). We address this gap in the literature in the current
article by examining individuals’ perceptions of biracial
job applicants. Using procedures developed by Kaiser
and Miller (2003) to study attitudes toward job candidates, we test whether Black=White candidates are perceived as less sociable than Black candidates during an
ostensibly genuine interview process. We hypothesize
that people perceive Black=White applicants as socially
unskilled primarily because of applicants’ biracial status,
above and beyond any effects that undesirable actions
(such as claiming discrimination) may have on applicants’ perceived sociability.
As we mentioned previously, past research suggests
that Black=White people experience less anti-Black
prejudice than their Black counterparts. According to
the Black Ancestry Prototype model, Black=White
people are viewed as relatively poor matches with Black
prototypes in terms of their appearances, traits, and
experiences (Sanchez et al., 2011). In support of this
model, research shows that as Black=White targets are
described to have more Black ancestry (i.e., described
as 25% vs. 50% vs. 75% Black), they are perceived to better align with Black prototypes. Increased Black ancestry
relates to increased perceptions of Black=White targets
as having dark skin, possessing stereotypically Black
traits (i.e., athleticism), and encountering more stereotypically ‘‘Black’’ experiences (i.e., discrimination; Sanchez
et al., 2011). Furthermore, minorities whose physical
appearances are less phenotypically prototypical of their
racial groups tend to be treated more positively by
social perceivers (Maddox, 2004; Maddox & Gray,
2002; Wilkins, Kaiser, & Rieck, 2010).
As a result of their biracial status, however, Black=
White people are targeted by negative stereotypes about

205

mixed-race individuals. According to past research,
perceivers often infer that mixed-race individuals are
awkward in social situations, are rejected by majority
and minority group members, and will experience difﬁculties in adjustment during adulthood (Chelsey &
Wagner, 2003; Jackman et al., 2001). To examine
whether these attitudes reﬂect objective differences in
adjustment between biracial and monoracial individuals,
Shih and Sanchez (2005) conducted a meta-analysis of
existing research. The authors concluded that although
biracial individuals experience unique developmental
challenges with which monoracial people do not have
to contend, biracial people tend to be just as well adjusted
as their monoracial peers. Nevertheless, Sanchez and
Bonam (2009) discovered that negative attitudes continue to dominate general perceptions of biracial individuals. The authors asked undergraduate students to
evaluate candidates for a minority scholarship. All of
the target candidates were described as excellent students;
however, the researchers manipulated whether the
candidates were revealed to be Whites, monoracial minorities, or biracials. The authors discovered that both
Black=White and East Asian=White candidates were
judged as less worthy of receiving the minority scholarship than were Black and East Asian candidates, respectively. Sanchez and Bonam (2009) also found that
participants perceived biracial candidates as less warm
and sociable than their monoracial minority counterparts and that these perceptions partially explained
ratings of low scholarship worthiness. Therefore,
although past research suggests that both Blacks (Fiske,
Cuddy, Glick, & Xu, 2002) and Black=Whites (Chelsey &
Wagner, 2003; Jackman et al., 2001) are perceived as
cold, the previous study directly compared these groups
and showed that Black=White people are judged less
positively than Black people. These ﬁndings support
our prediction that Black=White job applicants will be
viewed less as less sociable than Black job applicants.

WHEN AND HOW DO BIRACIAL
STEREOTYPES BIAS PERCEPTIONS?
It is also important to distinguish between the content of
Black and biracial stereotypes in order to understand
why Black=White job candidates should be disadvantaged relative to Black job candidates during interviews.
Black people tend to be stereotyped, speciﬁcally, as
hostile and aggressive (Devine, 1989), whereas biracial
people tend to be stereotyped as awkward, shy, and
anxious (Chelsey & Wagner, 2003; Jackman et al.,
2001). Stereotypes about poor social skills may be particularly likely to bias interviewers’ perceptions and lead to
negative evaluations of candidates because candidates’
interpersonal styles (e.g., ability to comfortably make

Downloaded by [University of Toronto Libraries] at 07:38 05 June 2012

206

REMEDIOS, CHASTEEN, OEY

‘‘small talk’’) factor heavily in employers’ hiring decisions
(Barrick et al., 2010). We expect that observers are more
likely to infer that biracial job applicants, as compared to
monoracial minority job applicants, exhibit awkward
social behavior during interviews. Whereas social
awkwardness is perceived as highly relevant to interview
performance (Barrick et al., 2010), it is unlikely that
perceivers view job interviews as contexts in which applicants are likely to express hostility and aggression. Black
stereotypes, in contrast, may be more likely to bias perceivers’ reactions to Black targets in highly threatening
contexts in which targets are apt to aggress against
perceivers (e.g., Correll et al., 2007).
Social skills stereotypes may bias observers’ perceptions of rejected job applicants, leading people to assume
that rejected biracial applicants were not hired because of
their poor interview skills. There are circumstances,
of course, under which minorities are clearly denied
employment for reasons other than their objective interpersonal and professional skills. Racial minorities face
varying degrees of discrimination in work environments,
ranging from obvious to more subtle. This source of
unequal treatment causes minorities to lose out on professional opportunities regardless of their qualiﬁcations
and skills (Clark et al., 1999; Dion, 2002). According
to Kaiser and Miller (2001, 2003), whose primary goal
was to examine reactions to Black discrimination claimants, observers are generally insensitive to the amount
of prejudice faced by Black job applicants who claim to
have been discriminated against. The authors discovered
that participants perceive discrimination claimants as
troublemakers even when they are clearly rejected
because of their race (Kaiser & Miller, 2003). Likewise,
we reasoned that if observers strongly believe that biracial individuals’ interpersonal skills contribute to their
inabilities to obtain employment, this belief should
persist even when biracial job candidates face certain
prejudice and claim to have been discriminated against.

STUDY OVERVIEW AND HYPOTHESES
The goal of the present study was to investigate whether
stereotypes about poor social skills characterize perceivers’ impressions of biracial job applicants. We were
interested, in particular, in whether such stereotypes bias
perceptions of biracial applicants when it is clear that
prejudice motivated the interviewer to render an unfavorable hiring decision. We compared observers’ perceptions of a Black and a Black=White job applicant who
faced either a certain (high) or an ambiguous (low)
amount of prejudice from a White interviewer. Job applicants, in addition, either acknowledged that they were
not hired because of their own interview skills or claimed
that discrimination had prevented them from obtaining

the position. The main dependent variables of interest
were participants’ ratings of how sociable the applicant
seemed, as well as participants’ opinions regarding why
the applicant was not hired.
We hypothesized that (a) participants would perceive
the Black=White candidate as less sociable than the Black
candidate, reﬂecting general stereotypes that mixed-race
people are socially unskilled, and (b) participants evaluating a Black=White candidate would be more likely than
those evaluating a Black candidate to assume that the
candidate was not hired because of his poor interview
skills. We expected these effects to be robust, furthermore, and to occur regardless of whether the applicants
faced certain prejudice or claimed to have been discriminated against.

METHOD
Participants and Design
Participants were 162 undergraduate students (110
female, 52 male) enrolled in an introductory psychology
course at the University of Toronto who took part in the
experiment for partial course credit. The majority of the
participants were East and Southeast Asian (n ¼ 70) and
White (n ¼ 50). Of the remaining participants, 15 were
South Asian, 11 were Middle Eastern, 8 were Black, 3
were Latin American, and 2 were Paciﬁc Islanders. Three
participants (1.9%) did not specify their race. The participants’ average age was 18.90 years (SD ¼ 1.70). The
experiment adopted a 2 (race of candidate: Black or
Black=White) Â 2 (interviewer prejudice: low or high) Â 2
(candidate attribution: interview skills or discrimination)
between-subjects design.
Procedure
Participants completed the experiment in groups of up to
four people while seated at private computer terminals. At
the beginning of the session, the experimenter informed
participants that their task would be to evaluate an
employment interview process. After providing informed
consent, participants viewed an introduction screen
explaining that a portfolio describing an actual job interview process would be selected at random and that they
would be asked questions about this portfolio after reading the provided information (Kaiser & Miller, 2003).
All of the participants ﬁrst read a job description for a
retail sales manager position that outlined qualiﬁcations
for the position as well as information about salary and
beneﬁts. Next, participants read about the person who
conducted the job interview. As in Kaiser and Miller
(2003), participants learned about the interviewer’s professional background and his appearance (blond hair

Downloaded by [University of Toronto Libraries] at 07:38 05 June 2012

STEREOTYPES AFFECT BIRACIAL JOB APPLICANTS

and fair skin, indicating that he was White) as well as the
questions he asked during the interview. Participants
read, for example, that the interviewer asked the applicant to describe his relevant work experience and discuss
how it prepared him for the position. We did not provide
participants with the applicant’s answers to the interview
questions. Participants also read a description of the
room in which the interview was conducted.
The participants then viewed information about
the job candidate, including his qualiﬁcations for the
position. The candidate’s previous work experience was
matched to the requirements detailed in the job description, and his application was noted as being ‘‘above average’’ in overall quality. Instead of including a photograph
of the job candidate as in Kaiser and Miller (2003), we
included a demographic questionnaire that had been
ostensibly ﬁlled out by the candidate. The form, which
had been completed on paper, scanned, and inserted
into the computer program as an image, listed several
ethnic categories. The category selected by the candidate
constituted our manipulation of candidate race. The
form revealed that the candidate had checked either
the ‘‘Black’’ or ‘‘Multiracial=Mixed-Race’’ category to
describe himself. In the latter case, the candidate further
speciﬁed, in handwriting, that he was Black=White.
Next, participants reviewed the interviewer’s hiring
decision and comments and learned that the candidate
was not offered the job. The interviewer’s explanation
for this decision was manipulated to reﬂect varying levels
of prejudice. We retained Kaiser and Miller’s (2003)
low-prejudice condition; however, we created our own
high-prejudice condition that included less transparently
prejudiced remarks than in the original study (see materials). Given that modern forms of bias are often subtle
(Swim, Aikin, Hall, & Hunter, 1995), presenting less
overtly prejudiced interviewer comments to participants
increased the ecological validity of the manipulation.
Participants then learned about the job candidate’s
attribution for why he was rejected by the interviewer
and completed questions about the candidate, the
interviewer, and the interview process. Finally, the experimenter debriefed participants, described the true nature
of the study, and thanked them for participating.
Materials
Interviewer prejudice manipulation. Participants in
the low-prejudice condition viewed the following
comments purportedly made by the interviewer:
I do not recommend that the company hire this applicant. Although the candidate had pretty good credentials, I decided to offer the job to another candidate
who seemed to have more potential to successfully
manage the retail sales team.

207

In the high-prejudice condition, participants viewed
the following interviewer comments:
I do not recommend that the company hire this applicant.
Although the candidate had pretty good credentials, I
decided to offer the job to another candidate who seemed
to have more potential to successfully manage the retail
sales team. Recently I’ve had bad experiences with people
from this group. Although some people like him work
out well, it’s still a big ﬁnancial risk. It takes a lot of effort
to train a new manager, and I’m not willing to invest
that time into someone unless I’m certain that they will
succeed.

Candidate attribution manipulation. Information
about the candidate’s attribution was conveyed through
a survey completed by the job candidate about the interview process. The candidate rated the extent to which six
possible factors, including discrimination and his personal interview skills, affected the hiring decision. The
attribution scales ranged from 0 (not at all) to 10 (very
much). The candidate rated only one factor as the main
reason for his rejection; some of the participants saw that
the candidate rated his interview skills, and some saw that
he rated discrimination as highly responsible (i.e., 8). All
other factors were rated by the candidate as not responsible (i.e., 1 or 2) for his failure to obtain the position.
Manipulation checks. To examine the effectiveness
of our prejudice manipulation, we asked participants to
rate the extent to which they believed that the interviewer
was racist. We also asked participants whether the candidate attributed his failure to get the job to discrimination
or to his interview skills. These items assessed participants’ sensitivity to the attribution manipulation. All
ratings were made on 7-point scales ranging from 1
(strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).
Ratings of the job candidate. All ratings of the job
candidate were made on 7-point scales ranging from 1
(strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Participants
were asked to provide their own opinions regarding
why the candidate was not hired by rating: ‘‘In your opinion, to what extent was the quality of the job candidate’s interviewing skills responsible for the decision
not to hire him?’’ (M ¼ 3.80, SD ¼ 1.61). We also asked
participants to rate the extent to which the job candidate
was sociable (i.e., the job candidate seems sociable, likable, easy to get along with, considerate, and good to
have as a friend; a ¼ .70, M ¼ 4.50, SD ¼ .78). Following
the measures administered by Kaiser and Miller (2003),
we asked participants to rate the extent to which the job
candidate was a troublemaker (i.e., the job candidate
seems hypersensitive, like a complainer, irritating, like

208

REMEDIOS, CHASTEEN, OEY

a troublemaker, and argumentative; a ¼ .75, M ¼ 3.34,
SD ¼ .98).2 Critically, we did not expect perceptions of
the Black=White and Black candidates to differ with
respect to troublemaker evaluations. Instead, based on
Kaiser and Miller’s (2001, 2003) ﬁndings, we predicted
that all discrimination claimants, regardless of their race,
would be perceived as troublemakers.3 We included this
measure in order to replicate past research and to establish sociability as the critical dimension on which perceptions of biracial and monoracial targets differ.

RESULTS
In all of the analyses reported next, we conducted 2 (race
of candidate: Black or Black=White) Â 2 (interviewer
prejudice: low or high) Â 2 (candidate attribution: interview skills or discrimination) analyses of variance to
examine our research questions.
Manipulation Checks
Interviewer prejudice manipulation check. The
results revealed a signiﬁcant main effect of interviewer
prejudice on participants’ ratings of the extent to which
the interviewer seemed racist, F(1, 154) ¼ 8.40, p ¼ .004,
g2 ¼ :05. Participants in the high-prejudice condition
p
(M ¼ 5.22, SD ¼ 1.63) rated the interviewer as more
racist than participants in the low-prejudice condition
(M ¼ 4.46, SD ¼ 1.72), indicating that our manipulation
was successful in establishing that the job candidates
faced different amounts of prejudice. We also found a
signiﬁcant main effect of candidate attribution, F(1,
154) ¼ 7.41, p ¼ .007, g2 ¼ :05. Participants in the disp
crimination attribution condition believed that the interviewer was more racist (M ¼ 5.19, SD ¼ 1.72) than those
in the interview skills attribution condition (M ¼ 4.50,
SD ¼ 1.64). No main effect of candidate race or interactions emerged in this analysis.
Candidate attribution manipulation check. Next, we
examined participants’ sensitivity to the candidate
attribution manipulation. The results revealed that, as
expected, participants in the interview skills attribution

We did not separately examine responses to Kaiser and Miller’s
(2003) niceness measure as sociability and niceness are likely very
highly related.
3
As in Kaiser and Miller (2003), in the current study we examined
whether participants felt that the job candidate had been true to himself (the job candidate seems true to himself, tackles problems head on,
believes that expressing his true opinions is important; M ¼ 4.78,
SD ¼ .88). Given the poor reliability of this scale (a ¼ .54), however,
as well as low correlations among the separate items (rs ¼ .18–.37),
we did not submit these items to statistical analysis.

condition believed more strongly that the candidate
had attributed his failure to get the job to his interview
skills (M ¼ 5.01, SD ¼ 2.12) than those in the discrimination attribution condition (M ¼ 2.35, SD ¼ 1.54), F(1,
154) ¼ 86.06, p < .001, g2 ¼ :40. Similarly, participants
p
in the discrimination attribution condition believed more
strongly that the candidate had attributed his rejection to
discrimination (M ¼ 6.63, SD ¼ .88) than those in the
interview skills attribution condition (M ¼ 3.40,
SD ¼ 1.63), F(1, 154) ¼ 244.82, p < .001, g2 ¼ :61. We
p
did not ﬁnd main effects of candidate race or interviewer
prejudice, nor did we observe any interactions.
Dependent Measures
Opinion regarding candidate rejection. Next, we
examined the extent to which participants believed that
the quality of the candidate’s interview skills contributed
to his rejection. Consistent with our predictions, we
observed a main effect of candidate race, F(1, 154) ¼
7.61, p ¼ .007, g2 ¼ :05. Participants who read about a
p
Black=White candidate believed more strongly that he
was not hired because of his poor interview skills
(M ¼ 4.09, SD ¼ 1.70) than participants who read about
a Black candidate (M ¼ 3.40, SD ¼ 1.51). We also
observed a marginal main effect of candidate attribution,
F(1, 154) ¼ 3.55, p ¼ .06, g2 ¼ :02, such that participants
p
were more likely to believe that the candidate who
blamed rejection on his interview skills was, in fact, more
likely to have been rejected due to the quality of his interview skills (M ¼ 3.96, SD ¼ 1.69) than the candidate who
claimed to have been discriminated against (M ¼ 3.51,
SD ¼ 1.57). We did not observe a main effect of interviewer prejudice, nor did we uncover any interactions.
This ﬁnding supports our hypothesis that participants
evaluating a Black=White candidate would be more
likely than those evaluating a Black candidate to assume
that the candidate was not hired because of his poor
interview skills.
Sociability rating. The results also yielded a main
effect of candidate race on perceptions of how sociable
the candidate seemed, F(1, 154) ¼ 4.06, p < .05, g2 ¼
p
:03. Participants evaluated the Black candidate as more
sociable (M ¼ 4.63, SD ¼ .81) than the Black=White candidate (M ¼ 4.37, SD ¼ .74). In addition, a signiﬁcant
main effect of candidate attribution emerged, F(1,
154) ¼ 4.36, p ¼ .04, g2 ¼ :03. Similar to Kaiser and
p
Miller’s (2003) ﬁndings for evaluations of niceness, participants in the discrimination attribution condition rated
the job candidate as less sociable (M ¼ 4.37, SD ¼ .85)
than participants in the interview skills attribution
condition (M ¼ 4.63, SD ¼ .70). There was no main effect

STEREOTYPES AFFECT BIRACIAL JOB APPLICANTS

Downloaded by [University of Toronto Libraries] at 07:38 05 June 2012

of interviewer prejudice, nor did we observe any
signiﬁcant interactions.
Troublemaker rating. The results revealed a signiﬁcant main effect of candidate attribution on participants’
ratings of the extent to which the candidate was a
troublemaker, F(1, 154) ¼ 40.21, p < .001, g2 ¼ :21.
p
Participants rated the job candidate as more of a troublemaker when he claimed that his rejection was due to discrimination (M ¼ 3.79, SD ¼ .85) than when he blamed
his interview skills (M ¼ 2.91, SD ¼ .91). No other signiﬁcant main effects or interactions emerged in this analysis.
Regardless of whether the candidate faced low or high
levels of prejudice from the interviewer, he was rated as
more of a troublemaker when he claimed to have been
discriminated against than when he invoked his own skills
as the reason that he did not get the job. This ﬁnding
replicates results reported by Kaiser and Miller (2003).

DISCUSSION
The present study demonstrates that Black=White
people are more likely than Black people to be perceived
as lacking the interview skills necessary to obtain
employment. Observers reviewed a portfolio describing
a job interview process involving either a Black=White
or Black applicant who was denied employment by a
White interviewer. The results revealed that observers
perceived the Black=White candidate as less sociable
than the Black candidate overall, in line with stereotypes
that biracial people are awkward in social situations.
The ﬁndings also indicated that participants who evaluated a Black=White applicant were more likely than
those who evaluated a Black applicant to believe that
the applicant was rejected because of his poor interview
skills. Participants attributed the interviewer’s unfavorable hiring decision to the Black=White applicant’s
interview skills regardless of whether there was a clear,
alternative reason (i.e., the interviewer was racist) that
the applicant was not hired, and regardless of the candidate’s own attribution for why he failed to attain the
position.
It is important to note that we observed that the
interviewer prejudice and candidate attribution manipulations worked as intended; participants perceived more
racism in the high (as opposed to low) interviewer prejudice condition and were aware that at times the candidate attributed rejection to discrimination and other
times attributed rejection to his interview skills. We
are conﬁdent, therefore, that participants explicitly disregarded both the presence of racism and the candidate’s own appraisal of the interviewer’s decision when
rendering judgments about the Black=White applicant’s

209

poor interview skills. Given that we did not test whether
participants correctly recalled the race of the candidate
at the end of the study, we were not able to exclude data
from participants for whom candidate race was not salient. The observed bias against Black=White applicants,
therefore, may well be conservatively estimated. The
current study is the ﬁrst, to our knowledge, to examine
how social skills stereotypes impact perceptions of
biracial people in job interview settings. We provide
evidence that stereotypes affect observers’ appraisals of
biracial job applicants, biasing perceivers’ opinions
regarding why mixed-race individuals encounter rejection in the job market. The ﬁndings present implications
for understanding social factors that affect biracial
people seeking employment and underscore the importance of studying perceptions of biracial people in
settings that require exceptional interpersonal skills. In
addition, we replicate past research showing that discrimination claimants are perceived as troublemakers,
regardless of whether they face apparent prejudice from
authority ﬁgures (Kaiser & Miller, 2001, 2003).
Although the current study focused on the consequences
of biracial stereotypes and not on perceptions of discrimination claimants per se, this replication effect
serves as a striking reminder of the social costs of
claiming discrimination!
The present study was inspired by evidence of a wage
gap between White and Black=White Americans. Examination of the 2000 census data reveals that, indeed,
Black=White men report earning signiﬁcantly less than
White men (controlling for age, educational attainment
and region of employment). No wage disparities emerge
between Black and Black=White male respondents (U.S.
Census Bureau, 2001). Fairlie (2009) noted that, if we
assume that Black=White people are treated less favorably than White people but more favorably than Black
people, we would expect Black=White workers to earn
signiﬁcantly more than Black workers. The prediction
that Black=White people should report higher wages
than Black people is also consistent with research suggesting that Black=White people face relatively little
anti-Black stereotyping both because of their partial
White ancestry (Sanchez et al., 2011) and their low phenotypically Black appearances (Maddox, 2004). According to census data, however, this prediction does not
hold. As a result, we turned to research on stereotypes
regarding mixed-race individuals’ poor social skills
(Chelsey & Wagner, 2003; Jackman et al., 2001; Sanchez
& Bonam, 2009) to examine ways in which Black=White
job applicants may be disadvantaged relative to Black
job applicants. Indeed, we observed that social skills
stereotypes inﬂuence perceptions of Black=White people
who are denied employment, leading observers to believe
that biracial job applicants are likely to have been
rejected because of their poor interview skills.

Limitations and Future Directions
In the current study we investigated perceptions of job
applicants who were not hired, as opposed to examining
opinions regarding who should be hired, because we were
concerned that research participants would be reluctant
to make unfavorable ‘‘do not hire’’ decisions when the
race of a minority candidate was salient. Social norms
dictate that minorities (particularly Blacks) should be
treated positively, and people comply with these norms
whether they personally value egalitarianism or believe
that political correctness is necessary to avoid social
sanctions (e.g., Devine, 1989; Shelton, Richeson, Salvatore, & Trawalter, 2005). Investigating hiring decisions,
as a result, is complicated by potential social desirability
biases toward making ‘‘hire’’ judgments that can obscure
race-related differences in perceptions of the applicants’
interpersonal skills. Instead, we examined perceptions
of candidates who faced certain discrimination as compared to those who were rejected for ambiguous reasons.
The present results provide compelling evidence that
participants will disregard obvious situational explanations (i.e., the interviewer is racist) for candidate rejection in favor of their own stereotypical attitudes that
biracial people are socially unskilled. Given this result,
we hypothesize that observers, including actual interviewers in workplace contexts, are likely to perceive the
social skills of Black=White people in biased ways. Such
biases may lead employers to rate Black=White applicants as less hirable and Black=White employees as less
suited for working in highly interpersonal environments
(e.g., retail settings as in the current study, as well as positions emphasizing relationship building with clients).
Ultimately, it is will be important for future research to
examine the attitudes and behaviors of interviewers in
actual workplace settings; therefore, additional work is
needed to investigate the previous claims.
It will be important, in addition, for future research to
test whether biracial people are perceived to be more sociable in the context of some work environments and not
others. Work environments in the United States are
becoming more and more diverse, and researchers have
started examining whether some people are better
equipped than others to cope during interracial interactions (e.g., Trawalter, Richeson, & Shelton, 2009). It
may be the case that biracial workers’ own complex racial
backgrounds make them particularly suited to dealing
with social issues of diversity and interracial harmony
(Shih & Sanchez, 2005). Past research suggests that biracial people are, in fact, more comfortable engaging in
interracial interactions than White people and monoracial
minorities (Bonam & Shih, 2009). It remains unclear, however, whether observers take this comfort with interracial
environments into account when evaluating the social
skills of biracial job applicants. In particular, it would be

interesting to test whether the negative consequences of
social skills stereotypes dissipate in the case of biracial
people seeking positions that emphasize the importance
of skillfully negotiating interracial interactions.
The present ﬁndings are limited, however, by the direct
way in which we revealed the applicant’s biracial status to
participants. Outside of the lab, mixed-race job applicants most likely do not disclose their biracial status in
such an overt way. Surprisingly little research has examined whether people can infer biracial status during
face-to-face interactions (as in interview situations); however, researchers generally agree that racial ambiguity is
correlated with biraciality (Pauker et al., 2009; Peery &
Bodenhausen, 2008; Remedios & Chasteen, 2011). Racial
ambiguity, therefore, may be used by perceivers to infer
biraciality when race is not disclosed. In addition, our
direct manipulation of biracial status is consistent with
other work in this domain (Sanchez & Bonam, 2009;
Sanchez et al., 2011) and, despite its practical limitations,
allows for experimental control that is particularly
important in the early stages of examining perceptions
of biracial people. In light of the current research it seems
as though biracial people who are able to conceal their
mixed-race heritages from interviewers should do so in
order to escape biased judgments based on negative
stereotypes. According to past research, however, biracial
individuals who disclose information about their race to
others experienced improved psychological well-being
(Sanchez & Bonam, 2009). Mixed-race job applicants,
therefore, may ﬁnd themselves forced to choose between
making good ﬁrst impressions during interviews or feeling good about themselves.
Conclusion
The present research shows that social skills stereotypes
affect evaluations of Black=White people who are denied
employment. Black=White job candidates were rated as
less sociable than Black job candidates overall and participants were more likely to infer that Black=White job
applicants were rejected by interviewers because of their
poor interview skills. We observed these stereotypical
attitudes, it is important to note, even among participants who acknowledged that the interviewer was
racist and who understood that applicants attributed
their own rejection to discrimination. The current ﬁndings further our understanding of the social factors that
may contribute to disparities in the treatment of Black
and Black=White job applicants. By demonstrating that
biracial people are perceived to perform more poorly
than monoracial minorities during job interviews, we
raise the possibility that people exhibit biases against
hiring mixed-race job applicants. Additional research is
needed to examine the contribution of anti-biracial
prejudice to hiring and wage disparities.
