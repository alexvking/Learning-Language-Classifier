ABSTRACT. There have been reports of butterﬂies that oviposit on non-native plants that do not support the development of the
larvae, and the ﬁtness cost of this behavior has been estimated in one such case. However, the long-term consequences of this ﬁtness cost for the population dynamics of such butterﬂies have not been studied. Here we report changes over 40 years in a population of Pieris macdunnoughii (Lepidoptera, Pieridae; formerly Pieris napi macdunnoughii Remington), which oviposits on a lethal,
non-native plant, Thlaspi arvense (Brassicaceae), as well as on suitable native hosts. Mark-release-recapture (MRR) studies conducted at four intervals over 40 years showed no signiﬁcant trends across years in population structure or dynamics, including estimated population density and temporal changes in the number of newly emerged individuals within a year. The estimated daily residence rate differed between the sexes. However, male estimated daily residence rate showed no signiﬁcant change across years.
Female residence rate was higher in the 2000s than in 1971; data were insufﬁcient to calculate a residence rate in 1972. The average ﬂight distance of female dispersants changed across years, but not as expected based on potential ﬂight distance and with no
clear pattern. Our detailed observations on female ﬂights at a local scale showed that ﬂight segments varied among different habitat
types deﬁned by aridity. Thus, although we see habitat effects on behavior, we did not detect any signiﬁcant changes in P. macdunnoughii population dynamics and large-scale structure across four decades, a century after the plant’s introduction.

Oviposition “mistakes” by butterﬂies on non-native
plants that do not support larval development have been
reported in the literature (summarized in Graves &
Shapiro 2003). Because young larvae generally cannot
move long distances, hatching on such a plant is usually
lethal. The habitat thus consists of patches with
differing butterﬂy ﬁtnesses, including a ﬁtness of zero in
non-native plant patches (Nakajima et al. 2013). Given
appropriate genetic variation, a population may evolve
to avoid oviposition on the non-native plant, or larvae

may evolve a tolerance for the non-native plant, as
indicated for Pieris oleracea and Alliaria petiolata
(Keeler & Chew 2008). In ecological time, the
population may be reduced in size due to the ﬁtness
cost of oviposition on the non-native plant. Ecology also
inﬂuences evolution: the butterﬂy's population structure
(e.g., habitat choice, short and long range dispersal
patterns as a function of habitat, age structure, daily
residence rate) and population dynamics (changes in
population numbers across time) inﬂuence the rate of

22

evolution, again given appropriate genetic variation
(Nakajima & Boggs in prep.).
Here we report work on the native butterﬂy Pieris
macdunnoughii (Lepidoptera, Pieridae; formerly Pieris
napi macdunnoughii; Chew & Watt 2006) in Gothic,
Gunnison County, Colorado, USA (38° 57' 22.89" N,
106° 59' 18.23" W; elevation 2885 m asl). Females of
this species oviposit on a lethal, Eurasian plant Thlaspi
arvense L. (Brassicaceae) (Chew 1977, Nakajima et al.
2013). Oviposition on T. arvense by P. macdunnoughii
was ﬁrst reported in the 1970s (Chew 1974) and has
continued since (Nakajima et al. 2013). Females in this
P. macdunnoughii population also oviposit on four
native Brassicaceae that support larval development:
Boechera spp. (formerly Arabis spp.), Cardamine
cordifolia A. Gray, Draba aurea Vahl ex Hornem., and
Descurainia incana (Bernh. ex Fisch. & C.A. Mey)
Dorn (formerly D. richardsonii Sweet) (Chew 1975,
Nakajima et al. 2013). Because P. macdunnoughii
females avoid oviposition on other unpalatable plants,
including the native Brassicaceae Erysimum asperum
(Chew 1974, 1975), oviposition on T. arvense most likely
results from mistakes due to shared oviposition cues
among T. arvense and the four native hosts on which
larval development is successful (Chew 1974, Chew &
Rodman 1980).
Thlaspi arvense most likely arrived at our site in the
mid-1800s (Chew 1977). The plant readily invades early
successional, disturbed sites (USDA 2013). Our study
site has been subject to continuous disturbance from
cattle grazing and localized human activities since the
mid-19th century (Vandenbusch 1980), so it is
reasonable to assume that the plant has been present in
the area since its initial introduction. Pieris
macdunnoughii has 1 generation per year at this
elevation (Chew 1974). Thus, the plant has been
present for more than 130 butterﬂy generations. The
potential also exists for strong selection against
oviposition on T. arvense, since the percentage loss of P.
macdunnoughii’s offspring due to oviposition on T.
arvense in the wild was estimated at 3.0 % in the late
1990s to early 2000s (Nakajima et al. 2013).
We therefore built on early studies in the 1970s on
the butterﬂy’s population structure and dynamics,
comparing population size, daily adult residence rates,
daily number of newly emerged individuals and
dispersal probability and distance across 40 years. If the
butterﬂies consistently lose 3.0 % of their offspring
every generation, the population size at the end of our
survey would be (1 – 0.03)40 = 0.30 of that in the
beginning. Contrarily, if the butterﬂies migrated into
and out of the study site, such that the local population
was a sink supported by outside source populations, the

JOURNAL OF THE LEPIDOPTERISTS’ SOCIETY

population would not have declined and the selection by
the non-native plant might be alleviated.
In addition to the long-range dispersal across the
study area described above, we also report female
butterﬂy dispersal patterns over a shorter range inside
the study site, at the scale of host plant patch. We
compared the butterﬂy’s movements among different
types of habitats preferred by different host plants. We
examined whether dispersal differed with individuals,
and if so, how they differed. Individual movements in a
small spatial scale, such as foraging and oviposition,
affect the individual performance and ﬁtness, dispersal
in a long range and hence the dynamics of population
(Hawkes 2009, Johnson et al. 1992). Indeed, in our
study system, butterﬂy movements at the scale of host
plant patch size affect encounter probability with the
lethal T. arvense, which directly inﬂuences ﬁtness. We
use this information to further understand the variance
of the long-range dispersals and the population
dynamics.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mark-release-recapture. We examined daily
population size, daily residence rate, daily number of
newly emerged individuals, and long distance dispersal
using standard mark-release-recapture (MRR)
techniques (Watt et al. 1977) in 1971, 1972, 2000 and
2010. The study area was divided into subsites that
differed among years (Fig. 1, Table 1). We analyzed the
population size, residence time and daily number of
newly emerged individuals using only the subsites that
were in common among all years (those in the circle in
Fig. 1). These subsites used for population analysis were
located in the Gothic townsite and surrounding
montane meadows. All ﬁve host plants, including T.
arvense, existed in the study site both in the 1970s
(Chew 1975, 1977) and in the 2000s (Nakajima et al.
2013). The other subsites were used to examine long
distance dispersal. These subsites consisted of meadows
along the Copper Creek drainage system, separated by
spruce-ﬁr forest and willow. Pieris macdunnoughii and
its native host plants were observed in these meadows in
the 1970s (Chew 1977) and in the 2000s (Boggs,
personal observation).
The method of MRR was consistent throughout our
40-year survey. Butterﬂies were captured during sunny
weather with hand nets, a number written on their
wings with an indelible marker, and released. We
recorded date, butterﬂy number, sex, subsite number
and wing wear. Wing wear is a surrogate measure of
adult age. We scored wing wear in increments of 0.5
from 1.0 to 5.0, where 1.0 is a fresh individual whose
wings are still damp and 5.0 is an individual with

extensive scale erosion and wing damage (Watt et al.
1977, 1979).
Daily population size was estimated using
POPSTRUC (Watt et al. 1977), which is based on a
Jolly-Seber analysis. We analyzed males and females
separately to satisfy the assumption of equal catchability
among individuals. We then calculated the daily
population density on each sampling day as the
estimated population size divided by the sampling area.
Area was calculated as the area of a polygon bounded by
the subsites used in each year, calculated using ArcGIS
10.1 (Esri, Redlands, CA, USA) as shown in Table 1.
We estimated the average adult daily residence rate,
, for each sex and year using recapture decay plots. A
recapture decay plot is the linear regression of the
ln(total number of butterﬂies known to live at least d
days) against day number d (Watt et al. 1977). The
number of butterﬂies known to live at least d days is

JOURNAL OF THE LEPIDOPTERISTS’ SOCIETY

based on the interval between ﬁrst and last capture of
each individual. Ln is the slope of the regression line.
First, we tested whether the slopes of the male and
female regression lines were signiﬁcantly different. We
used an ANCOVA with sex as a categorical factor and
“d” as a covariate. Signiﬁcance of the interaction sex ×
d means that slopes, and therefore , differ between
the sexes (Zar 1999). If the slopes were different
between males and females, we compared the slopes
among years within each sex. If the slopes were not
signiﬁcantly different, we calculated the common slope
(Zar 1999). We also calculated −(ln)−1 as the mean
expectation of residence.
Daily number of newly emerged individuals was
examined in order to determine whether multiple
generations ﬂew during each growing season. The
number of individuals with wing wear score equal to or
lower than 2.0 at any point in time was used as an

variances of the population size standardized by the MRR sampling area. The symbol frequently hides the small error bars.

VOLUME 68, NUMBER 3

estimate of the newly emerged adults in the population.
If a second generation eclosed, we would see 2 peaks in
the time series of the number of newly emerged adults
in one year.
To analyze dispersal probability, we used all subsites
in each year. We examined the proportion of individuals
that had moved to a new subsite on recapture
(dispersants) out of the total individuals recaptured. We
compared the proportion dispersing between males and
females by 2 test.
Again using all subsites in each year, we approximated
dispersal distance using the distance between the
centers of the subsites where an individual was
recaptured and where it was immediately previously
captured. Therefore, the dispersal distance is 0 when an
individual was recaptured in the same subsite. We
calculated the dispersal distance as the sum of distances
between recaptures for each butterﬂy; if one individual
was recaptured at subsites A, B and C in this order, its
dispersal distance would be the distance between A and
B plus the distance between B and C. The ﬂight
distances of dispersants were compared between males
and females and among years by examining the
signiﬁcance of the independent variables in a
generalized linear model (GLM) [distance = year + sex
+ (year × sex)] assuming errors distributed as Poisson.
We used the function “glm” in R (version 3.0.1, R
Development Core Team 2013) for the analysis. We
should note, however, that the minimum- and
maximum-detectable ﬂight distance differed among
years (Table 1) and might have caused us to identify
erroneous differences in dispersal distance. In such a
case, the fractions of dispersants would be higher and
the mean ﬂight distances would be shorter in 2000 and
2010, which had shorter detectable distances than other
years. Our analysis also assumes equal capture effort
among years. Although the people who collected the
data changed over our 40-year survey, they all used a
standardized method (described in Watt et al. 1977).
Butterﬂy short range movement patterns.
Thlaspi arvense preferred dry and intermediate habitats
and was distributed sparsely in our study area, similar to
Boechera spp., De. incana and Dr. aurea, whereas C.
cordifolia preferred wet habitats and occupied larger
patches with higher plant density (Nakajima et al. 2013;
the details of habitat aridity classiﬁcation is also
described therein). To compare short range dispersal
within each habitat type, we observed female butterﬂy
movement in three 20 × 20 m quadrats in 1997 in each
of three habitats: dry, intermediate and wet. Dry and
intermediate plots were both grasslands with Boechera
spp. sparsely distributed throughout the plots. We
assumed that the results in the dry and intermediate

5

plots would be equivalent to those in habitats with T.
arvense because Boechera spp. and T. arvense often
coexist, and P. macdunnoughii did not intentionally
avoid T. arvense for oviposition (Chew 1974). Indeed, a
previous study showed that the density of P.
macdunnoughii’s eggs per plant was not signiﬁcantly
different among the host plants including T. arvense
(Nakajima et al. 2013). The wet plot was dominated by
1.5–1.8 m tall willow (Salix sp.). The open areas within
the wet plots were dominated by C. cordifolia.
The perimeter of each quadrat was marked with red
ﬂags at every meter on all sides. A string grid was laid
across every other meter on both sides. We observed
individual females that either ﬂew into the quadrat or
were released outside the quadrat and ﬂew into it.
Observers sitting on a ladder recorded female
movement within the quadrat on a grid map. Alighting
coordinates were marked with an “x” and time spent
sitting was recorded. We then approximated the
female’s movement as a sequence of straight lines. We
calculated ﬂight distances (lengths of straight lines) and
turning angles (angles between two consecutive ﬂights)
from each butterﬂy’s map.
To test for the effects of plot on turning angles and
ﬂight distance using repeated measurements on
butterﬂies, we developed generalized linear mixed
models (GLMMs) with “ID”, i.e., butterﬂy’s individual
ID number as a random effect, and “plot” as an
independent variable. We estimated the standard
deviation for the random effect to quantify the variation
between individual butterﬂies. We then compared this
GLMM to the GLMM without the independent
variable “plot” (null model) by likelihood ratio test. We
considered that plots affected the turning angles and the
ﬂight distances if the model with “plot” and the null
model were signiﬁcantly different. We predicted that
the butterﬂies ﬂew in shorter distances in wet sites than
in drier sites because C. cordifolia makes relatively
dense patches than other host plants in dry and
intermediate habitats. We expected that the turning
angles were random in all sites and therefore the
frequency of turning angles would show normal
distributions with the mean at 0 degrees. Models were
ﬁtted by the function “lmer” and normality of turning
angles was tested by Shapiro-Wilk test using the
function “shapiro.test”, both in the statistical software R
(R Development Core Team 2013).
RESULTS
Population size, age, and long distance ﬂight.
The estimated population density did not show any
trend across sampling years (Fig. 2). The estimated daily
population densities within a year showed bell-shaped

curves across the ﬂight season, with large ﬂuctuations in
both sexes in all years. The estimated variances of the
population size (error bars in Fig. 2) were often small,
especially in females, due to small sample sizes (Jolly
1965; see Table 1 for sample sizes).
The number of individuals at condition 2.0 or lower
across time within each sampling year was either
monotonic or unimodal in males in 1972 and 2000,
showing no signs of a second brood (Figs. 3B and 3C).
In other data, a small second peak was observed in midJuly after a larger peak in mid- or late June or at the
beginning of sampling (Fig. 3). These were unlikely a
second brood because the time between the ﬁrst and
the second peaks was less than a month, which is too
short for the offspring of adults emerged at the ﬁrst
peak to become adults. Larval development takes about
14 to 17 days for P. macdunnoughii (Chew 1975), and
pupation lasts another 10 days (C. Boggs, pers. obs.)
under laboratory conditions which promotes faster
development than natural conditions. It is possible that
our data did not cover the entire ﬂight season. Pieris
macdunnoughii emerged from pupal diapause in late
May and early June, and the next generation entered

pupal diapause at the end of the summer at least in the
1970s (Chew 1975). Thus, we could have missed the
extreme earliest part of the ﬂight season, although it is
unlikely that an entire generation of adults preceded the
sampling period.
The slopes of regression lines for recapture decay
plots (Fig. 4) differed signiﬁcantly between males and
females (F = 62.57, df = 1,115, p < 10-11). The slopes did
not differ among years in males (F = 0.96, df = 1,70, p =
0.33) but differed signiﬁcantly in females (F = 11.09, df
= 1,41, p = 0.002). Only 1971, 2000 and 2010 data were
used for the females, since data were insufﬁcient to
examine the slope in 1972 females. Since the females’
slopes did not differ between 2000 and 2010 (F = 0.097,
df = 1,26, p = 0.051), we obtained a new, common slope
for the 2000s. Thus, from the regressions, the daily
residence rates, , were 0.83, 0.96 and 0.73, and the
expected average residence times were 5.6, 22.5 and 3.3
days for males (all years combined), females in 2000s,
and females in 1971, respectively.
The proportion of recaptured animals dispersing did
not differ between males and females across all years
(Table 2). However, the proportion dispersing differed

between the 1970s and 2000s with sexes combined
(1970s: 0.26; 2000s: 0.58; see Table 2 for statistics).
Mean ﬂight distances of dispersing animals differed
among years (z = 3.4, p = 0.0007) and between the sexes
(z = 25.4, p < 10−15). The interaction between year and
sex was also signiﬁcant (z = −25.2, p < 10−15), indicating
that ﬂight distance did not change in concert in the two
sexes across years.
Butterﬂy short range movement patterns. We
obtained 44, 51 and 41 ﬂight segments from 12, 22 and
7 females at dry, intermediate and wet plots,
respectively.
The standard deviations for the random effect in
turning angles and ﬂight distances were both 0.000. For
turning angles, the null model was not signiﬁcantly
different from the full model (2 = 0.250, df = 1, p =
0.62). For ﬂight distances, the null model was
signiﬁcantly different from the full model (2 = 13.97, df
= 1, p = 0.0009). The full model was also signiﬁcantly
different from the null model when we used the data
from dry and wet plots (2 = 10.55, df = 1, p = 0.001)
and dry and intermediate plots (2 = 8.00, df = 1, p =
0.005), but not when we used data from wet and
intermediate plots (2 = 1.25, df = 1, p = 0.26). This
result indicates that ﬂight distance differed between dry
plots and intermediate/wet, with females ﬂying shorter
distances between landings in the intermediate/wet
plots.
Flight distance was distributed exponentially in all
plots (Figs. 5A, 5C, 5E). The distributions of turning
angles (Figs. 5B, 5D, 5F) did not differ signiﬁcantly
from a normal distribution except for the wet plot (dry:
W = 0.97, p = 0.40; intermediate: W = 0.97, p = 0.31;
wet: W = 0.94, p = 0.04). The turning angles in the wet

plot were distributed bimodally (Fig. 5F). The mean
turning angles were −2.4, 17.0, and 5.3 degrees in dry,
intermediate and wet plots, respectively.
DISCUSSION
Our results indicated that the dynamics and structure
of this P. macdunnoughii population have not changed
signiﬁcantly over four decades. The estimated
population density did not decrease detectably from
1971 to 2010, in spite of the continued presence of the
lethal invasive plant T. arvense. In addition, the adult
daily male residence rate did not change over time. The
daily residence rate of females differed signiﬁcantly
between 1971 and the 2000s, although we emphasize
that that could be due to small sample sizes (10
individuals recaptured in 1971 and fewer in the 2000s).
Finally, the temporal changes of the number of newly
emerged butterﬂies did not differ among years.
The dispersal of males did not differ from what we
expected from the detectable ﬂight distances. We did
not ﬁnd any difference between males and females in
the proportion of individuals dispersing. On the other
hand, the cumulative ﬂight distance of dispersants
depended on both sex and year. In males, the mean
ﬂight distance was longer in the 1970s than in the 2000s,
as predicted from the detectable ﬂight distance.
However, we did not ﬁnd any pattern in females. We
need further study to specify the factors that inﬂuence
dispersal.
Our observations of butterﬂy movements at small
scales may provide a hint for factors governing dispersal
observed at larger scales. As we predicted from the host
plant distribution, the distance per ﬂight segment was
longer in dry habitat than that in wetter habitat. In

and 67.4, and 17.0 and 69.5, respectively.

addition, our wet plot contained tall willows. In avoiding
these obstacles, butterﬂies may have made shorter
ﬂights with turning angles avoiding the willows rather
than longer direct ﬂights, resulting in the bimodal
distribution of turning angles observed only in the wet
plot. Thus, the different host plant distributions in
different plot types may have caused the observed
difference in dispersal. Our study also suggested that
the dispersal pattern did not vary among individuals.
Furthermore, female P. macdunnoughii were caught
more frequently in wetter sites than in dryer sites in
another MRR study on the same system (Nakajima et al.
2013), suggesting that females tend to stay longer in
wetter sites. This habitat effect may also apply at the
larger scale of our MRR study.
In conclusion, we did not detect any negative changes
on P. macdunnoughii population dynamics. This
suggested that the lethal, non-native plant had not
signiﬁcantly affected the butterﬂy’s population. Several
factors may have maintained variation for oviposition on
this plant in the intervening time, including
immigration, shifting host plant patch geography and
drift (Nakajima & Boggs in prep.). Our study conﬁrmed
migration of P. macdunnoughii between Gothic
Townsite where T. arvense existed and Copper Creek
where T. arvense had not been seen (Chew 1977, Boggs,
personal observation). It is possible that the habitats in
Copper Creek served as population source.
There is a potential for T. arvense, however, to affect
population size and structure in the future. For
example, T. arvense may increase in abundance because
it favors disturbed areas and our study site experiences
frequent human disturbance from construction and
other activities (Boggs, pers. obs.). It is also possible for
butterﬂy to evolve in response to T. arvense. Genetic
variation does exist within the population for female
oviposition choice (Boggs et al. in prep.). Contrarily,
there is no indication of variation within the Colorado
population in ability to complete development on the
plant, although hybrid crosses with Swedish P. napi
suggest that normal larval development on the plant is
controlled by one or a few autosomal genes (Boggs &
Wiklund in prep.). Further analysis combining the data
reported here and prospective modeling of dynamics at
our study site will provide important information for
other systems involving lethal non-native “hosts”.
