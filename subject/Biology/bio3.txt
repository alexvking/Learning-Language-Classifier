Abstract Exploitation of patchy light is a key determinant of plant performance in the forest understory. While
many adaptive traits are known, the role of stem vasculature in understory photosynthesis is not established.
Sectoriality—the degree of vascular constraint to long
distance transport—has been hypothesized to limit growth
in heterogeneous light. We simulated the photosynthetic
potential of sectored and integrated plants in patchy light,
as a function of soil water potential (patchy or uniform).
We used hydraulic parameters typical of temperate woody
species in an Ohm’s law model including a tangential
resistance parameter, and simulated cavitation by varying
axial resistance of leaves, leaves and roots, or the whole
plant. Our results suggest that differential sectoriality will
not affect photosynthesis when water is plentiful, but can
constrain stomatal conductance at more negative soil
water potentials, especially when only a small portion of
the crown receives light. This effect is strongest just
below the turgor loss point, and depends on axial resistance and soil water heterogeneity. Increased resistance in
high light leaves decreases photosynthesis regardless of
sectoriality. However, when resistance is increased for

decreases more for sectored than for integrated plants.
Moreover, the simulations suggest that sectoriality can
further depress photosynthesis when water availability is
asymmetrical. These results might explain why integrated
species, such as Betula lenta, B. alleghaniensis, and Acer
saccharum thrive in the forest understory and grow rapidly into canopy gaps, while sectored species, such as
Quercus rubra, do not.

Introduction
As sessile organisms, plants experience unique challenges
in resource acquisition, especially in highly patchy environments. Young trees in the forest understory experience
particular extremes in resource heterogeneity: these plants
must be able to photosynthesize at baseline light levels
5–10% of full sunlight, while maintaining the ability to
efﬁciently exploit infrequent high light patches with
intensities similar to full sunlight. Plants growing along the
edges of forest gaps experience similar extremes. Transient
light patches may strike individual branch for as little as
seconds to hours at a time, but often represent the majority
of photosynthetically active radiation that understory plants
receive in a day (Singsaas et al. 2000; reviewed by Knapp
1992). In shade-adapted plants, many physiological and
anatomical leaf traits have been documented to increase
plant performance when light comes as infrequent patches
(e.g. Pearcy et al. 1997; Sack et al. 2003), but less is known
about adaptive responses to light heterogeneity at the
whole plant level. Speciﬁcally, is the ability to exploit high

Fig. 1 Diagram of portions of idealized tree considered in our
simulation models. In each tree, the leaves exposed to a high light
patch and the associated vasculature are shown in color. Integrated
plants possess the ability to use uncolored, as well as colored stem
tissue to supply water to leaves in high light. Highly sectored plants
depend primarily on the colored stem tissue for water supply. For
modeling purposes, we simulate the proportion of leaf area in high
light relative to the rest of the plant by adjusting the relative resistance
of stem, leaf, and roots for each of two ‘‘sectors’’, where the two
sectors correspond to the portion of biomass in each of the two
possible light environments. We simulate plants where equal portions
of the leaf biomass are in high versus low light (a), and plants where
one-tenth as much biomass is in high light relative to low light (b).
We hypothesize that leaves in smaller light patches will beneﬁt more
from integration than leaves in light patches shared by a larger portion
of the crown

light patches dependent upon the unimpeded transport of
water and nutrients to that part of the crown? It has been
shown that hydraulic conductivity can constrain photosynthesis in water-limited conditions (e.g. Jones et al.
2010), but the role of whole plant hydraulics in patchy
conditions has received less attention. In this context,
vascular sectoriality—the degree to which long distance
resource transport is constrained to speciﬁc pathways
between root and shoots—could pose an important limitation on photosynthetic potential and ultimately on growth
(sensu Gloser et al. 2008). Indeed, in a principal component
analysis of 18 temperate woody species, Zanne et al.
(2006) noted a strong negative correlation between sectoriality and shade tolerance, which the authors hypothesized
to reﬂect the beneﬁts of low sectoriality under variable
light conditions. We might also expect that under dry soil
conditions, the ability to use the entire root system to
supply water to high light leaves would extend the conditions in which leaves can effectively exploit light patches.

123

Sectoriality is known to vary considerably among
woody species (Greenidge 1955; Kozlowski and Winget
1963; Orians et al. 2004, 2005; Ellmore et al. 2006; Gloser
et al. 2008). Members of the ring porous genus Quercus
display high sectoriality compared to the members of the
diffuse porous genus Acer, while Betula species have lower
sectoriality still (Orians et al. 2004; Ellmore et al. 2006;
Gloser et al. 2008). ‘‘Double saw cut’’ experiments demonstrate one aspect of the physiological impact of this
variation. In these experiments, overlapping horizontal saw
cuts are used to sever xylem vessels at different heights up
the trunk, forcing any water ﬂow through the trunk to occur
along indirect pathways (Tyree and Zimmerman 2002).
Integrated species—those with low sectoriality—are able
to maintain normal crown functioning with a much smaller
distance between cuts than can high sectoriality species.
For instance, Betula occidentalis was shown to maintain
normal stem conductance with overlapping saw cuts as
little as 1 cm apart through a *1 cm diameter portion of
the main axis (Sperry et al. 1993). In contrast, leaves of
Acer pseudoplatanus saplings quickly wilted when overlapping cuts were less than a critical distance of 2 cm apart
(Mackay and Weatherly 1973). Even more extreme vascular changes cuts are observed in Quercus rubra, in which
individual earlywood vessels can range from 1 to 10 m in
length, resulting in vascular restriction over axial distances
of many meters from a single saw cut (Tyree and Zimmerman 2002). Thus, saw cut experiments show that
integrated species can tolerate and recover from greater
extremes of physical damage than can sectored species, but
the effect of sectoriality on responses to milder stressors
such as patchy light and water is not known.
Here, we present a modeling framework to examine the
potential role of xylem sectoriality in limiting photosynthesis by understory trees. We simulate plant hydraulics
using an Ohm’s law analogy circuit, modiﬁed to introduce
a parameter to describe the stem tangential resistance to
ﬂow between sectors. Combining this framework with
published models for photosynthesis, we simulate the
effects of soil water limitation on photosynthetic potential,
for patchy light conditions and varied levels of sectoriality.
This approach contrasts with more detailed xylem network
models (e.g. Loepfe et al. 2007), in that we vary a single
sectoriality parameter to capture overall patterns in tangential hydraulic resistance, without delving into anatomical details, such as the degree to which these patterns
depend on vessel-to-vessel lateral connections and the
presence of ‘‘cross-grained’’ vessels (Tyree and Zimmerman 2002; Orians et al. 2004; Nadezhdina 2010). Our
purpose is to establish general expectations for the relationship between sectoriality and photosynthesis, to inform
future empirical research.

status, water potential, transpiration, and photosynthesis.
We then describe the simulations tested.

Materials and methods
Model overview
We model photosynthesis in patchy light conditions by
combining published models for stomatal conductance,
carbon assimilation, and transpiration with a novel construct for modeling xylem sectoriality. To simulate sectoriality, we simplify the vasculature of a plant as divided
into two sets of parallel pathways (‘‘sectors’’), each comprising the xylem vessels directly feeding a portion of the
crown. These sectors may correspond to two equal halves
of the plant (Fig. 1a), but can also be used to designate
asymmetrical portions of the plant, e.g. one sector corresponding to a small portion of the crown receiving direct
sunlight while the other sector corresponds to shaded
portions of the crown (Fig. 1b). Leaf water status,
dynamically determined by the balance of transpiration and
water supply to the leaves of each sector, is the basis for
water potential gradients within and between sectors. These
gradients are simulated using the Ohm’s law analogy for
plant hydraulics (Fig. 2; Tyree and Ewers 1991). In these
models, the hydraulic resistance within a sector is inversely
proportional to the biomass of leaves in that sector, and the
hydraulic resistance to ﬂow between sectors is manipulated
as a parameter characterizing xylem sectoriality.
Parameters for all components of the model are summarized in Table 1 and additional variables are deﬁned in
Table 2. In the next two subsections, we present the

Fig. 2 Circuit model for hydraulic ﬂow at varied levels of sectoriality. We model sectored ﬂow through the plant using the circuit in a,
where sectoriality increases with the value of the sectoriality
parameter rt. For each sector (1 or 2), the hydraulic resistances
(r) and water potential sources (W) are shown for different plant
components (l leaves, b branches and leaves, a stem axis, r roots, and
sr soil-root). The stem is axially divided into n repeating segments by
n ? 1 tangential resistors. Only the bottom and top segments are

Sectoriality model and hydraulic parameters
To simulate the effects of sectoriality on leaf water supply
and the resulting effects on photosynthesis, we use the
Ohm’s law analogy to simulate hydraulic ﬂow through a
pair of parallel pathways (‘‘sectors’’) running axially
through a plant. The leaves and roots of each sector are
independent, but the stem vasculature is interconnected.
Speciﬁcally, the stem axial pathway is divided into
n identical segments by the presence of n ? 1 tangential
resistors which constrain ﬂow between the two sectors
(Fig. 2). The resistance of each tangential resistor scales
with a tangential resistance parameter rt and with the
number of resistors included in the model (Fig. 2a). When
the value of rt is zero, the plant is considered to be perfectly
integrated, and the two axial pathways through the stem
function as a pair of resistors in parallel (Fig. 2b). As the
parameter rt approaches inﬁnity, the plant approaches
perfect sectoriality (Fig. 2c). We assume that all hydraulic
resistances and soil water potentials are constant, while the
leaf water potentials vary dynamically as a function of leaf
water content for each sector i. Water content increases
with the ﬂux (qli) of water into the leaves sector i, and
decreases with transpiration from those leaves (Eli). We
simulate photosynthesis over time, using Kirchoff’s

(c)

shown, with the intervening segments indicated by dashed lines. The
stem axial resistance for each sector i is subdivided into n equal
resistors each with 1/n of the overall axial resistance, and the sectors
are connected by n ? 1 resistors each with resistance rt (n ? 1). The
arrows designate the hydraulic ﬂux (q) into the leaves of each sector.
When the parameter rt is equal to zero, the model is equivalent to the
circuit depicted in b. As rt approaches inﬁnity, the circuit approaches

In both models, the ﬂow of water vertically in each
sector of the plant is constrained by the hydraulic resistances to ﬂow through leaves and branches (rb), along the
main stem axis (ra), and through the roots (rr). In general,
rb is assumed to be 25% of the whole plant resistance, with
the assumption that leaves present the primary resistance in
the branches (Sack et al. 2003), and rr is assumed to be
60% of whole plant resistance while the ra is the remaining
15% (based on data from Nardini and Salleo 2000). Water
ﬂow within and between sectors is driven by two sources of
water potential in each sector i: the leaf water potential

123

(Wli)—calculated from the leaf water content (Eqs. 1–3),
and the water potential difference between the soil and
roots (Wsri)—a parameter representing the additive effects
the soil matric potential and the difference in osmotic
potential between the soil and the root xylem. The leaf
water potential for sector i (Wli) is calculated as the sum of
the osmotic (Woli) and pressure potentials (Wpli) of mesophyll tissue, with the assumption that gravitational potential will not signiﬁcantly affect ﬂow:
Wli ¼ Wpli þ Woli :

of this paper, but would be expected to yield qualitatively
similar results.
We assume that stomatal pores adjust in size to meet the
carbon demands of photosynthesis, but that their maximum
size is constrained by leaf water status. We model stomatal
conductance to carbon dioxide (gCi) per leaf area in sector i
as the minimum two possible models: a model based on
potential carbon ﬁxation rates (UCpi) and a model based on
leaf relative water content (hwli) (both adapted from

Transpiration, photosynthesis, and leaf water status
Photosynthetic responses to light patches depend on stomatal conductance, which, in turn, depends on a variety of
internal and external factors, including leaf water status.
Following models presented by Thornley and Johnson
(2000), we model stomatal conductance as a function of
light conditions and water status, photosynthesis and transpiration as a function of stomatal conductance, and
dynamically model leaf water status as determined by
transpiration and leaf ﬂux. Since our interest is in vascular
architecture, and not the detailed dynamics of stomatal
physiology, we chose to model stomatal closure as a simple
function of leaf hydration. More detailed stomatal models

Similarly, since we assume that stomatal conductance
either adjusts to maximize photosynthesis or—when water

times as much leaf biomass and one tenth of the hydraulic
resistance for branches, stems, and roots (Fig. 1). Light
patches (high light conditions; Ls = 1.0) represent ten
times the light intensity of the baseline low light conditions
(Ls = 0.1). We ﬁrst examine changes that occur immediately following an increase in light availability, and then
focus on the simulated effects of sectoriality on steadystate photosynthesis that occurs after 1 h of patchy light at
a range of soil water potentials. To examine the potential
consequence of increased resistance due to droughtinduced embolisms, we simulated three different embolism
scenarios, where in each case embolism in a tissue was
simulated as increased resistance in that tissue (either 29
or 109 the default resistance). The scenarios were (1)
increased resistance in only the leaves in the high light
branch, (2) increased resistance in all leaves, as well as in
the roots, and (3) increased resistance axial resistance
throughout the entire plant. Finally, we simulated the
effects of non-uniform water supply, with soil water
potential 0.1 or 0.5 MPa more positive for the shaded
portion of the plant than for the high light sector.

Results
According to our model, when leaves are ﬁrst exposed to a
light patch, transpiration (Fig. 3a) and photosynthesis
(Fig. 3c) are unaffected by sectoriality, but when soil water
potential is low transpiration outpaces hydraulic ﬂux into
leaves and leaf water content is drawn down (Fig. 3b)
resulting in lower rates of photosynthesis (Fig. 3c). This
effect is stronger for sectored than for integrated plants. As
leaf water content goes down, leaf water potential becomes
more negative, and ﬂux into the leaf increases, while
transpiration decreases (Fig. 3a), until (after approximately
3600 s = 1 h) a steady state is reached with lower leaf
water content and photosynthesis for sectored than integrated plants (Fig. 3b, c).
At more positive soil water potentials, water never limits
photosynthesis, and so no sectoriality effects are observed,
while at strongly negative water potentials, water constrains photosynthesis for integrated as well as sectored
plants (Fig. 4). When half of the crown experiences high
light, the strongest beneﬁt of integration—with a theoretical maximum photosynthesis 5% higher for integrated than
sectored plants—are observed just as leaves are beginning

Trees (2011) 25:833–845

to lose turgor (-1.5 MPa at a whole plant hydraulic
resistance of 4.0 MPa day g-1 m-2; Fig. 4a). The potential effect is stronger when only a small portion of the
crown experiences high light—photosynthesis 6% higher
for perfectly integrated plants (Fig. 4b).
When resistance is elevated only for the leaves on the
high light portion of the plant, sectoriality effects decreased
for large light patches, and slightly increased for small light
patches (see supplemental material in Online Resource Fig.
S1). However, when resistance is elevated for the leaves
and roots of the entire plant, sectoriality becomes a much
more important constraint (Fig. 5). When leaf and root
hydraulic resistance is increased by a factor of two and half
of the crown receives high light, the effect of sectoriality is
only slightly different from the baseline resistance
(Fig. 5a), but when only a small portion of the crown is
illuminated, the potential photosynthetic beneﬁt of integration increases to about 20% at -1.5 MPa (Fig. 5b).
When leaf and root resistance increased by a factor of ten,
the photosynthetic rate for integrated plants is just over
20% higher than for sectored plants at -0.95 MPa when
half the crown is in high light (Fig. 5c) and this difference
increases to 50% at -1.2 MPa when only a fraction of the
crown is illuminated (Fig. 5d). Similar outputs, but with
greater sectoriality effects, are observed when the resistance of the main axis is increased as well (see supplemental material in Online Resource Fig. S2).
Even at baseline levels of whole plant axial resistance,
the effects of sectoriality increase dramatically when soil
water is assumed to be non-uniform (Fig. 6). If the roots
directly feeding the shaded portion of the crown experience
water potentials 0.1 MPa more positive than the roots
directly connected to the high light portion of the crown
(which would occur when higher transpiration rates in the
high light patch reduces water availability in that sector of
the plant), the potential beneﬁt of integration is 10% when
half the crown is in high light (-1.6 MPa for the high light
sector; Fig. 6a) and 19% when the high light sector represents one tenth the leaf area of the low light sector
(-1.6 MPa for the high light sector; Fig. 6b). With a more
extreme gradient of 0.5 MPa between the roots of high and
low light sectors, the potential beneﬁt is greater still: 30%
when half the crown is in high light (-1.8 MPa for the high
light sector; Fig. 6c) and 56% when the high light sector
represents one tenth the biomass of the low light sector
(-2.0 MPa; Fig. 6d).

Discussion
Our model output supports the hypothesis that xylem sectoriality could constrain photosynthesis in patchy light
conditions, but suggests that under uniform water supply

841

these effects would be slight—at least for temperate trees
with no loss of stem conductance (Fig. 4). Under these
conditions, the inﬂuence of sectoriality was somewhat
stronger when a small portion of the crown is illuminated
(Fig. 4b) than when half of the crown is in high light
(Fig. 4a). Thus, the effects of sectoriality on photosynthesis
are expected to be strongest when only a small portion of
the crown is illuminated at any time, supporting the idea
that integration is adaptive for trees growing in strongly
shaded conditions, hypothesized by Zanne et al. (2006).
The small effect of sectoriality depicted in Fig. 4 results
from a low overall plant resistance, such that leaf water
potential closely tracks root potential. As a result, when
root water potential is uniform, there is never a substantial
hydraulic gradient between sectors (sensu Zwieniecki et al.
2003). We selected hydraulic resistance values from the
literature, but it should be noted that these values for
hydraulic resistance represent well-hydrated plants (Sack
et al. 2003; Ellmore et al. 2006). At low water potentials,
cavitation is common (Hacke et al. 2006). Published vulnerability curves show substantial cavitation in the -1.0 to
-2.0 MPa range for non-desert species. For example:
Betula occidentalis shows dramatic percent loss conductance at -1 MPa, reaching 50% loss by -1.5 MPa; Acer
negundo shows steady loss of conductance at negative

pressures, with 50% loss at -2.5 MPa; and Populus tremuloides shows substantial cavitation at -2.0 MP, with
50% loss by -2.5 MPa (Hacke et al. 2001). Ring porous
species show steeper vulnerability curves but maintain
conductivity at much lower water potentials. As an
example of ring porous species, Q. gambelii experiences a
50% loss around -0.5 MPa, but has mean cavitation
pressures around -4.0 MPa, and similar curves were
observed for other species of Quercus (Hacke et al. 2006).
Thus, since sectoriality was only found to affect photosynthesis at low soil water potential, it is important to
consider how sectoriality changes when the axial resistance
of leaves, roots, and/or the main stem axis is increased.
Leaves and roots tend to be particularly sensitive to
embolism. In most trees, the greatest xylem tension—and
thus greatest embolism risk—is in the leaves; but for a
given xylem tension, roots are generally most vulnerable to
embolism (cited in Choat et al. 2007). Our model outputs
suggest that embolism only in the leaves exposed to high
light will increase sensitivity to soil drying, but will not
substantially increase the effects of sectoriality. When a
large portion of the crown is illuminated, the sectoriality
effects are (if anything) diminished, while a very slight
increase in sectoriality effects may occur when a smaller
portion of the crown is affected (see Online Resource Fig.
S1). These outputs reﬂect the fact that with the strongest
resistance in the leaves, the ability to use parallel stem and
root transport pathways will not dramatically increase
water supply to the leaves. In contrast, increasing overall
resistance by a factor of two or more throughout the crown
and roots (Fig. 5) or in the whole plant (see Online
Resource Fig. S2) dramatically increases sectoriality
effects. These increases to whole plant resistance result in a
greater water potential drop between soil and leaves and a
stronger gradient between sectors.
The idea that cavitation could increase the beneﬁts of
integration is an interesting one for several reasons. First of
all, it underlines the importance of a variety of biotic and
abiotic factors in determining the ecological role of sectoriality. Inter-species comparisons in sectoriality have
generally focused on a single metric, such as anatomical
traits (Ellmore et al. 2006), dye movement (Kozlowski and
Winget 1963; Orians et al. 2004), isotope movement
(Postlethwait and Rogers 1958; Orians et al. 2004, see also
review by Watson and Casper 1984), or hydraulic resistance to tangential ﬂow (Ellmore et al. 2006; Zanne et al.
2006; Orians et al. 2005). Our results further suggest that
the degree of xylem crossover could depend on water
status, cavitation susceptibility, and inherent axial resistances. In addition, leaf traits also affect the relationship between leaf water status and leaf water potential
(Sack et al. 2003), and so are expected to inﬂuence the
formation of hydraulic gradients between sectors. These

123

Trees (2011) 25:833–845

considerations suggest probable differences between the
‘‘realized sectoriality’’ as observed by the movement of
water and nutrients through the xylem and the ‘‘intrinsic
sectoriality’’ as determined by xylem anatomy. This distinction between realized and intrinsic sectoriality is not
generally emphasized in papers examining the ecological
signiﬁcance of inter-species differences in sectoriality (e.g.
Zanne et al. 2006) but has been alluded to certain papers,
e.g. in the changes in sectoriality of source-sink dynamics
with ontogeny (Preston 1998). Our output suggests that
while sectoriality correlates with embolism resistance,
embolism formation may also result in lower ‘‘realized
sectoriality’’ in light limited conditions.
Secondly, there are fascinating questions to be addressed
regarding the interactions between sectoriality and drought
tolerance. A common hypothesis to explain the existence of
high sectoriality species is that sectoriality helps prevent
the spread of runaway embolism (Orians et al. 2004), and
this idea is consistent with empirical studies showing a
correlation between sectoriality and drought tolerance
(Zanne et al. 2006; Schenk et al. 2008). Variation in sectoriality among desert and chaparral shrubs shows a strong
positive correlation between drought tolerance and sectoriality (Schenk et al. 2008). Zanne et al. (2006) showed the
same pattern for temperate trees, but none of the species
examined in that study were characterized as both drought
tolerant and shade tolerant. We know of no studies that
have speciﬁcally examined the relationship between sectoriality and drought tolerance in understory or shade-tolerant species. Nonetheless, indirect support for the
hypothesis that integration is beneﬁcial in understory species in dry conditions can be gleaned from the literature
(Zanne et al. 2010). We took species described by Zanne
et al. (2010) and separated them by shade and drought
tolerance (classiﬁcations from Niinemets and Valladares
2006). As predicted, the shade-tolerant species with the
highest drought tolerance indices showed among the lowest
vessel areas and higher vessel numbers (Fig. 7). Interestingly, the opposite trend was seen for shade-intolerant
species (data not shown). For a given vessel area fraction,
higher vessel number implies higher vessel surface area,
more opportunities for vessel-to-vessel contact, and
potentially higher integration (Zanne et al. 2010). Based on
our model output and these published data, we suggest that
exploration of sectoriality traits in shade-tolerant species
from different moisture environments would be a fruitful
line of future research.
The above observations depend on the assumption that
soil water potential is uniform. When water supply is
patchy—due to heterogeneity of soil conditions, topography, throughfall, or hydraulic activity of either the focal
plant or its neighbors (Stark 1994)—the simulated effects
of sectoriality become more pronounced. In these

Trees (2011) 25:833–845

conditions, hydraulic gradients in the soil drive inter-sector
ﬂow in the plant. When strong gradients in soil water
correlate with light availability, such as would be expected
if evapotranspiration under long-term light heterogeneity
depletes soil water for roots in the high light sector, sectoriality becomes much more costly (Fig. 6). This situation
may be most frequent when one side of the plant consistently receives high light, such as at a forest edge. Other
sources of water heterogeneity may or may not correlate
with light conditions. Hydraulic lift by neighboring trees
can result in signiﬁcant water potential gradients, which
could result in more positive water potentials closer to a
large neighbor, where shade may also be greater. Gradients
of 1.0 MPa have been documented between 0.5 and 5 m
distance from the trunk of Acer saccharum, with more
positive water potentials close to the trunk as a result of
hydraulic lift (Dawson 1993 cited in Caldwell et al. 1998).
On the other hand, decreases in soil water due to transpiration from neighboring trees would result in the opposite
gradient, while rain throughfall is expected to be highest
under canopy gaps where light is also higher (e.g. Breshears et al. 1997). When the soil water gradient is such that
water content is higher for roots directly connected to high
light branches, integration is expected to be costly, since it
will tend to result in hydraulic redistribution toward the
low light sector. Thus—depending on site characteristics—
light heterogeneity may be positively or negatively related
to water heterogeneity, or there may be no relationship.
Data light and water heterogeneity at scales relevant to
individual plants may provide important insights into the
suitability of a particular site for high- versus low-sectoriality understory plants.
Implications for species-speciﬁc sectoriality
In addition to providing general predictions for the qualitative effect of sectoriality on photosynthesis, our model
also sets up a quantitative framework for comparing sectoriality between different species. Our output suggests that
photosynthesis is only sensitive to sectoriality when the
overall tangential resistance is between 1 and 100 times the
stem axial resistance, with the greatest variation between 1
and 10 times axial resistance. This result illuminates the
relationship between previously documented variation in
interspecies sectoriality and the probable ecological relevance of this sectoriality. For instance, we estimate from
published data that 1 cm diameter stems of Acer and Betula
have an rt between 0.2 and 1 times the axial resistance
(Sperry et al. 1993, data from Ellmore et al. 2006). In
contrast, excised stem segments of the same diameter for
Quercus rubra showed tangential resistance 30 times the
stem axial resistance (Ellmore et al. 2006). This suggests
that variation in sectoriality among relatively integrated

843

diffuse-porous species (Acer and Betula) would be more
biologically meaningful than among highly sectored ringporous species (such as Quercus).
Our model output therefore supports the hypothesis that
vascular integration helps integrated species such as Betula
alleghaniensis and Acer saccharum thrive in the forest
understory and grow rapidly in response to gaps, while
sectored species such as Quercus rubra do not (Kobe et al.
1995; cited in Nowacki and Abrams 1997). Furthermore,
our model output suggests that Betula and Acer saplings
will continue to display some integration as trunk diameter,
and therefore tangential resistance, increases. Small differences in sectoriality may have a large effect on the ability of
these species to exploit patches as they increase in size.
A. saccharum often spends 20 or more years growing in
shaded conditions (Canham 1985), and B. alleghaniensis is
documented to commonly achieve stem diameters of 18 cm
before gap openings permit rapid increases in growth
(Webster and Jensen 2007). Therefore, these species may
experience substantial selection for decreased sectoriality in
the understory.
In contrast, our model suggests that 1 cm diameter
Q. rubra already experience nearly complete sectoriality,
which would only increase with diameter. A small change
in the level of connection among parallel vessels would be
unlikely to change this fact, reducing the likelihood sufﬁcient phenotypic variation for natural selection on the
sectoriality in Q. rubra and closely related species. Indeed,
dye injection experiments have shown that in both bur oak
(Q. macrocarpa Michx.) and white oak (Q. alba L.), the
width of the streak produced by dye movement through the
transpiration stream was nearly constant with height
(Kozlowski and Winget 1963). On the other hand, the same
study documented a gradually widening dye streak for
northern pin oak (Q. ellipsoidalis Hill), suggesting some
hydraulic integration for this species. The high sectoriality
for oak might be explained by the particular vulnerability
of ring porous species to freezing-induced embolism
(Davis et al. 1999) or to the large space between individual
xylem vessels that is distinct to oaks (Ellmore et al. 2006).
The relative simplicity of our model provides a useful
framework for thinking about sectoriality that may be
extended for a variety of applications. In particular, by
characterizing sectoriality in terms of the parameters rt and
ra, our model suggests a new approach for comparing
sectoriality across species and across size classes. There is
promising potential for adapting the model to predict species-speciﬁc allometric changes in sectoriality. For
instance, ra is expected to increase with tree height, and
with circumferential path traveled (i.e. with diameter), but
to decrease with sapwood thickness and with sapwood
cross-sectional area. These general relationships may be
combined with existing allometric models (e.g. West et al.

123

844

1999) to generate predictions for how sectoriality will
change with growth. The model might also be used to scale
the results of hydraulic experiments on stem segments (e.g.
Zanne et al. 2006; Ellmore et al. 2006) to predict whole
plant level in order to predict responses to defoliation,
vascular damage, or light heterogeneity.
Some limitations may exist in generalizing the model
across size classes, however, particularly for very large
trees. In large trees, sectoriality has been shown to depend
not only on intervessel pitting (Orians et al. 2004; Ellmore
et al. 2006) but also on ‘‘cross-grained’’ drift of vessels
with height up the tree (Tyree and Zimmerman 2002; Kitin
et al. 2004). While intervessel pitting constrains ﬂow
between sectors in the presence of a hydraulic gradient, as
is represented by our model, cross-grained drift is expected
to result in tangential spread of resources independent of
such a gradient (Nadezhdina 2010). Empirical work will be
required to determine the applicability of the model in trees
displaying substantial drift, and it should be noted that the
frequency of drift in younger trees has not been established.
It may be that the most realistic approach to modeling
sectoriality across size classes would combine our Ohm’s
law approach with xylem network topology models (Steppe
et al. 2004) or modeling wood as an anisotropic solid
(Schulte and Costa 2010), such as that presented by Steppe
et al. (2004).

Conclusions
The model in this paper presents a novel framework for
quantifying sectoriality, used here to predict the relationship between xylem sectoriality and photosynthesis for
trees in the forest understory or along forest/gap edges.
Simulation outputs suggest that under baseline hydraulic
and environmental conditions, sectoriality should present
only a modest constraint to photosynthesis, but that when
xylem resistance is increased or water supply is non-uniform, this pattern can change dramatically. These predictions may be particularly valuable for understanding
changes in species composition with climate change,
especially with changes in precipitation. In moist regions,
tree species may not previously have experienced selection
based on vascular restrictions, but as drought becomes
more frequent this could change. Previous research has
emphasized the role of sectoriality in preventing the spread
of embolisms (Schenk et al. 2008), but our results suggest
that for understory trees experiencing drought, selection
may be more complicated than previously recognized.
Our model provides a quantitative means of relating
hydraulic properties of excised stems to expected whole
plant functionality in vivo, and may help establish a relationship between the ‘‘realized sectoriality’’ as observed

123

Trees (2011) 25:833–845

through transport patterns and the ‘‘intrinsic sectoriality’’
as characterized by xylem anatomy. Combined with allometric models for changes in hydraulics with stem diameter, our modeling framework can be used to generate
speciﬁc biological predictions from hydraulic data. The
development of allometric models for xylem sectoriality
would be particularly useful in relating data from different
types of studies, such as comparing experiments using
1 cm diameter stems (e.g. Zanne et al. 2006; Orians et al.
2004) to patterns of resource or dye movement in larger
trees (e.g. Greenidge 1955; Kozlowski and Winget 1963).
Our model could also be easily extended to include stem
water storage, through the inclusion of capacitors in our
circuit model, to examine the role of transport of stored
water between sectors in more dynamic responses to
heterogeneity.
To our knowledge, the model presented here represents
the ﬁrst functional model to describe the potential consequences of woody plant sectoriality. Our approach provides
important insights into short-term hydraulic dynamics in
response to patchy light. Future modeling efforts should
examine the theoretical inﬂuence of vessel topology relative to inter-vessel pitting, in order to improve theoretical
comparisons of sectoriality between species, and should
include allometric scaling relationships to relate models for
sectoriality of different sized saplings. In sum, our model
presents a promising framework for making speciﬁc predictions about plant responses to heterogeneity. With
adjustments to scale allometrically and to better adapt idiosyncracies of vessel anatomy, this framework can be
adapted for tight partnership with empirical studies on
species-speciﬁc responses to environmental heterogeneity.
