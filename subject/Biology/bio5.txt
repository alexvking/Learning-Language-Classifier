We have isolated and characterized a new endoderm-specific gene, designated Endol6, from a sea urchin gastrula
stage cDNA library. Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization experiments indicate that this gene is first
expressed in the vegetal plate, a group of endodermal and mesenchymal precursor cells that are poised to invaginate in
the first movement of gastrulation. Expression becomes progressively restricted to a subset of endodermal cells as
development proceeds. To study the End016 gene product, a polyclonal antiserum was raised against bacterially
expressed End016 protein. Indirect immunofluorescence experiments in midgastrula stage embryos reveal that the
End016 protein is localized to the surface of endoderm and secondary mesenchyme cells. In Western blot experiments,
the antiserum detects a small set of high molecular weight proteins ranging from 180 to >300 kDa. Analysis of the
nucleotide-derived amino acid sequence from a partial End016 cDNA clone reveals a highly repetitive, extremely acidic
protein segment that includes the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) tripeptide known to be important in cell binding domains of a
number of extracellular proteins. Taken together, these data suggest that the End016 protein may be an adhesion
molecule involved in gastrulation of the sea urchin embryo. o 1989

INTRODUCTION

The use of cloned gene probes and monoclonal antibodies (McAb) has facilitated the identification of an
expanding set of lineage-specific molecules in the sea
urchin embryo (reviewed in Davidson, 1986; McClay and
Wessel, 1985). Knowledge of how expression of these
molecules is regulated as well as what role the gene
products play in development is crucial to understanding how this complex multicellular
organism arises
from a single cell, the fertilized egg. In mesenchyme
blastula stage sea urchin embryos five distinct lineages
can be identified on the basis of morphological criteria
and lineage-specific markers: the oral and aboral ectoderm, the primary mesenchyme, the small micromeres,
and the vegetal plate, which later gives rise to endoderm and secondary mesenchyme. It is the vegetal plate
cells that perform the morphogenetic movements that
accomplish gastrulation in these embryos. These movements are accompanied by changes in cell shape, pulsatile behavior, filopodial activity, and extensive cell repacking (reviewed by Keller and Hardin, 1987). In a
detailed analysis of sea urchin morphogenesis, Gustafson and Wolpert (1967) proposed that all of the cell
rearrangements which occur in the course of embryogenesis could be explained in terms of dynamic changes
in cell adhesions and cell migrations. Since the time of
their proposal, a growing body of evidence has been

accumulating in support of the role of cell adhesion in
sea urchin morphogenesis. Recently, several lines of experimental evidence implicate cell-cell and cell-matrix
adhesions in sea urchin gastrulation. Inhibitors of Nlinked glycosylation (Heifetz and Lennarz, 1979), proteoglycan synthesis (Karp and Solursh, 1974;’ Katow
and Solursh, 1979), and collagen synthesis or processing
(Butler et aZ.,1987; Wessel and McClay, 1987), as well as
McAb fragments directed against the apical extracellular matrix protein hyalin (Adelson and Humphries,
1988), are all capable of preventing gastrulation. However, little is known about specific molecules expressed
by vegetal plate cells and their descendants that participate in adhesive interactions involved in gastrulation.
In this report we describe the isolation and characterization of a new endoderm-specific gene designated
Endol6. Using in situ hybridization and indirect immunofluorescence, we have investigated the spatial and
temporal expressions of the End016 transcript as well
as localization of the End016 gene product. The results
of these investigations, along with analysis of the nucleotide-derived amino acid sequence of the End016
cDNA clone, lead us to propose that the End016 protein
may play a role in cell adhesion and gastrulation in the
sea urchin embryo.

described (Pittman and Ernst, 1984).
Isolation and characterization of SpGl6 cDNA clone.
All enzymes were purchased from Promega Biotech or
New England Biolabs except as indicated. All isotopes
were purchased from Amersham. Standard molecular
biology techniques were used (Maniatis et al, 1982). The
1.3-kb HindIII-BamHI
fragment of the Caenorhabditis
elegans ~01-1gene (Kramer et al., 1982) (~01-1gene, gift
of J. Kramer and D. Hirsch; subclone, gift of Dr. H.
Boedtker) was nick-translated and used to screen a S.
purpuratus gastrula stage XgtlO cDNA library (gift of
T. Thomas and E. Davidson) containing 10,000 recombinant clones. Hybridization conditions were 5X SSC, 5X
Denhardt’s, 0.1% SDS at 55°C. Washing was performed
under the same conditions. Positive clones were
plaque-purified and phage DNA was isolated and digested with EcoRI to determine insert size. One clone,
XSpG16, contained the largest cDNA insert and this
insert was subcloned into pUC8 to create the plasmid
pEndol6 and into m13mp18 for restriction mapping and
sequence analysis. Sequencing was performed using the
Sequenase kit (US Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Asymmetric probes were prepared using standard sequencing reactions on Northern
blot strips which were hybridized, washed, and exposed
as described below.
Genomic Southern blot. Sperm was collected from a
single spawned animal and DNA isolated by the method
of Kedes et al. (1975). Ten micrograms of genomic DNA
was digested with EcoRI or HindIII, electrophoresed on
a 0.65% agarose gel, and blotted to nitrocellulose. The
filter was hybridized overnight with nick-translated
End016 at 65°C in 5X SSC, 5X Denhardt’s, 0.1% SDS.
Washing was done at 65°C in 1X SSC, 0.1% SDS. Autoradiography was for 24 hr using Kodak XAR-5 film and
a DuPont Cronex intensifying screen.
Northern blot analysis. RNA from egg, 16-cell, 128cell, 20-hr hatched blastula, 26-hr mesenchyme blastula, 36-hr gastrula, and 80-hr pluteus embryonic stages
and adult tissues was prepared by the procedure of
Chirgwin et al. (1979). Ten micrograms total RNA was
electrophoresed on 1% agarose/formaldehyde gels and
blotted to nitrocellulose. Nick-translated End016 and a
control probe were used to probe filters. Hybridization
and washing conditions were as for the genomic blot.
Autoradiography
was for 48 hr using Kodak XAR-5
film and a DuPont Cronex intensifying screen.
In situ hybridizations. The 550-bp EcoRl-HpaII fragment from pEndol6 was subcloned into the Sp6/T7
transcription vector pGem-7Zf (Promega Biotech). This
construct was used to synthesize either sense or antisense RNA probes with the Riboprobe kit (Promega
Biotech) according to the manufacturer’s instructions

with [35S]CTP(800 CVmmole, Amersham). Probes were
synthesized to a specific activity of -1 X lo* cpm/pg.
The final concentration of probe in the hybridization
solution was 3.3 X lo6 cpm/ml.
Embryos were fixed, embedded in paraplast, sectioned, and spread onto polylysine-coated slides as described by Cox et al. (1984). Hybridization and washing
were performed according to the modifications of Hardin et al. (1988) for 35Sprobes except that no dehydration through a graded ethanol series was done preceding the formamide wash and 2X SSC was substituted
for 0.3 M NaC1/20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Slides were
processed for autoradiography as described (Angerer
and Angerer, 1981). Exposure time was 3 days for all
sections shown, except pluteus stage which was for 9
days.
Fusion protein production and puri~cation. To construct the Trp-End016 fusion protein, the 550-bp
EcoRI-HpaII fragment of the End016 cDNA was ligated into EcoRI-CZaI digested pATH1 (Dieckmann and
Tzagoloff, 1985) and transformed into Escherichia coli
strain RRI. This arrangement fuses the End016 fragment in frame with the truncated E. coli TrpE gene
under the control of the Trp promoter/operator
sequences. Induction of the fusion protein was accomplished by growing cells overnight in M9 media supplemented with 0.5% casamino acids, 20 pg/ml L-tryptophan, and 50 pg/ml ampicillin. The cells were then
diluted 1:lO in the same media minus tryptophan and
grown for 1 hr at 30°C with vigorous aeration. At this
time 5 pg/ml indoleacrylic acid (Sigma) was added to
the cultures and incubation continued for 2 hr. For sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE)
analysis, 1 ml of culture was pelleted and resuspended
in 50 ~1 of sample buffer (Laemmli, 1970). Ten microliters of sample was loaded per lane. The fusion protein
was purified by preparative gel electrophoresis. Gels
were stained briefly in 4 M Na acetate (Higgins and
Dahmus, 1979) and bands were excised and eluted by
crushing and soaking overnight in 3 vol of 1 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5,0.1 mMEDTA, 0.05% SDS. The sample was
dialyzed against 10 mMTris-HCl, pH 7.5,150 mMNaC1,
1 mM EDTA, precipitated, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Protein concentrations
were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit.
The P-gal-End016 fusion protein was constructed by
ligating the 794-bp End016 cDNA into EcoRI cut
pUR288 expression plasmid (Ruther and Mtiller-Hill,
1983) and transformed into E. coli strain JMlOl. Induction of the fusion protein was accomplished by adding
0.5 mM isopropylthio-fi-galactoside
and growing at
37°C for l-3 hr, and resulted in over production of a
protein at the expected -150 kDa size (data not shown).
Polyclonal antiserum. Preimmune serum was col-

lected from the rabbit before antigen injections began.
The primary immunization consisted of 200 pg TrpEEnd016 fusion protein emulsified in Freund’s complete
adjuvant injected intradermally. The animal was given
two booster injections at 3-week intervals consisting of
150 pg TrpE-End016 fusion protein emulsified in
Freund’s incomplete adjuvant.
Western blot analysis. Total embryo protein lysates
were prepared as described (Wessel and McClay, 1987);
25 pg of lysate was loaded per lane of 10% SDS-PAGE
and electroblotted to nitrocellulose (Towbin et ah, 1979).
Filters were blocked in 5% dry milk/PBS for 1 hr, incubated in 1:lOOOdilution of preimmune or immune
serum in PBS for 1 hr, washed in 5% dry milk/PBS for 1
hr, incubated in 1:‘7500dilution of goat anti-rabbit:alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Promega Biotech) for 1
hr, and washed again in 5% dry milk/PBS for 1 hr. The
reaction was visualized by incubating in alkaline phosphatase substrate according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega Biotech).
Indirect immunoJuorescence. Embryos were settled
onto polylysine-coated coverslips and fixed in 90%
methanol/seawater on ice for 30 min. Embryos were
then rehydrated to PBS through a graded methanol
series. Embryos were incubated in 3% BSA/PBS for 15
min, 1:lOOdilution of immune serum in PBS for 1 hr, 3%
BSA/PBS 1 hr, 1:lOO dilution of fluorescein-conjugated
goat anti-rabbit antiserum (Polysciences) 1 hr, and 3%
BSA/PBS 1 hr. The reaction was viewed and photographed under a Zeiss microscope equipped for epifluorescence using Kodak T-Max film at an ASA setting
of 800.
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

Cloning and Sequence Analysis of the Endo

cDNA

The 794-bp End016 cDNA clone was selected from a
sea urchin gastrula stage XgtlO cDNA library on the
basis of low stringency hybridization to a C. elegans
collagen type 1 probe. The restriction map and genomic
representation of this clone are shown in Figs. la and
lb. The End016 cDNA probe hybridizes to a single DNA
fragment in both EcoRI and HindIII-digested
sea urchin genomic DNA, indicating that the End016 mRNA
is transcribed from a single copy gene (Fig. lb). The
transcriptional orientation of this gene was determined
by hybridizing strand-specific End016 probes to Northern blot strips of gastrula stage RNA. Only one of these
two probes reacts with an mRNA transcript, 6.6 kb in
length (Fig. lc). Sequence analysis of the cDNA clone
revealed that the entire 794-bp insert is an open reading
frame which could encode 265 amino acids (Fig. 2A).
Although the DNA sequence of the sea urchin clone
does contain short regions of up to 65% similarity to the

C. elegans gene (data not shown), the predicted amino
acid sequence of the sea urchin clone does not contain
any collagen-related sequence, including that of recently reported sea urchin collagens (Venkatesan et al.,
1986; Saitta et al., 1989). However, the deduced amino
acid sequence does display several noteworthy features.
The sequence includes an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD; boxed in
Fig. 2A), which has been shown to be important in the
cell binding domain of many extracellular proteins (reviewed in Ruoslahti and Pierschbacher, 1987). Two potential N-linked glycosylation sites are present (underlined in Fig. 2A), although the proline containing site is
probably not utilized (Hubbard and Ivat, 1981). In addition the sequence contains six clustered copies of a
20-amino acid repeat (Fig. 2B), two of which are in tandem. Overall, this protein segment is very hydrophilic
and extremely acidic, comprised of 30% glutamic and
aspartic acid residues. A computer-assisted search,
using the algorithm of Lipman and Pearson (1985), has
not identified significant similarity of End016 with any
sequences contained in the GenBank or EMBL nucleic
acid databases, nor is the deduced amino acid sequence
related to any protein sequence compiled in the NBRF
or Institut Pasteur databases.
Temporal and Spatial Expression of Endo
during Embryogenesis

Transcript

Northern blot analysis was used to examine the developmental expression pattern of the End016 mRNA
transcript. The results of this experiment are shown in
Fig. 3. The 794-bp cDNA hybridizes to a single 6.6-kb
transcript that is not detected in egg or morula stages,
but is first detected at the hatched blastula stage. The
transcript increases in abundance by the mesenchyme
blastula stage, continues to increase during gastrulation, and declines in abundance by the time the formation of the pluteus larva is complete. The End016 transcript was not detected in any adult tissue examined,
including testis, ovary, intestine, coelomocyte, and tube
foot RNAs. A reprobing of this blot with a sea urchin
actin probe demonstrated the integrity of all the RNA
samples (data not shown).
The embryonic distribution of End016 transcripts
during development was determined by in situ hybridization. The results of these in situ hybridizations with
radioactively labeled End016 antisense probes and developmentally staged embryo sections are shown in Fig.
4. In 28-hr mesenchyme blastula embryos, the autoradiographic signal is concentrated over the vegetal plate
region. These cells are poised to invaginate in the first
movement of gastrulation to form the archenteron,
which later gives rise to the endoderm and secondary
mesenchyme tissues. No signal above background is de-

tected over primary mesenchyme or ectodermal cells. In
36-hr gastrula stage embryos the End016 mRNA is detected in cells in all regions of the archenteron. By the
72-hr prism stage, the archenteron has begun constriction to form a tripartite larval gut. At this stage, hybridization is restricted to the posterior two-thirds of
the gut (mid- and hindgut) which will become the larval
stomach and intestine. No signal is detected over secondary mesenchyme cells at this stage. Interestingly,
hybridization to 90-hr pluteus stage larvae shows labeling of stomach only. We did not obtain any tissue sections in which all three digestive tract regions were
clearly identifiable. However, sections which included
esophagus and stomach or stomach and intestine all
showed labeling of stomach tissue exclusively. A representative example of control hybridizations
with
End016 sense probes is shown in Figs. 4A and 4B. In
these controls, a low level of background signal is present evenly distributed over the tissue sections. These
results demonstrate that the End016 gene is expressed
in a spatially regulated, lineage-specific manner and
that this expression becomes restricted during differentiation.
Production and Specificity of Polyclonal Antiserum
To facilitate study of the End016 gene product, polyclonal antibodies were generated. A bacterial fusion

protein was produced using one of the PATH series of
plasmid vectors and employed as the source of antigen.
The plasmids contain a truncated E. coli trpE gene with
a synthetic polylinker at the 3’ end. A 550-bp restriction
fragment of the End016 cDNA was subcloned into the
polylinker of pATH1 so that the correct translational
reading frame was preserved. Induction of the trp promoter by simultaneous tryptophan starvation and exposure to indoleacrylic acid results in the production of
large quantities of the trpE fusion protein in cultures
harboring the expression plasmid. Protein extracts
from induced and uninduced cultures were analyzed by
SDS-PAGE, and the appropriately sized fusion protein
band was observed after staining with Coomassie blue
(Fig. 5A). The fusion protein was purified by preparative gel electrophoresis and used for immunization of a
Dutch Belted rabbit.
To determine the reactivity of the resulting antiserum against the sea urchin portion of the fusion protein, we produced a second fusion protein using the pUR
series of plasmid vectors. These vectors allow the expression of protein coding sequence as C-terminal addition to E. coli ,&galactosidase. Induction of the P-galEnd016 fusion protein resulted in overproduction of a
protein of the expected -150-kDa size as judged by
Coomassie blue staining of whole cell extracts electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Figure 5B
shows the results of Western blot experiments reacting

of the coding strand (as determined by the strand-specific hybridization, Fig. lc) is shown. The entire 794-bp cDNA is an open reading frame
encoding 265 amino acids. The sequence includes a potential cell attachment site (RGD, boxed) as well as two potential N-linked glycosylation
sites (N x S/T, underlined). (B) End016 repeats. Six copies of a 20-amino acid repeat are present in the End016 sequence. Exact matches that

the anti-End016 serum with both fusion proteins. As
anticipated, the serum reacts strongly with the TrpEnd016 protein used in the immunization protocol. The
serum also reacts very strongly with the P-gal-End016
fusion protein, indicating that the sea urchin portion of
the Trp-End016 fusion protein elicited a strong immune
response. The lower molecular weight bands present
must be due to breakdown products of the fusion protein since they are not present in the lane containing
the parent plasmid. Therefore, the majority of the immune response was elicited against the Trp-End016 fusion protein and little response was directed at any contaminants present in the preparation used for immunization.
To investigate the expression of the End016 gene
product in sea urchin embryos, the polyclonal antiserum was reacted with total sea urchin gastrula stage
protein extracts in Western blot experiments. Preimmune serum, collected from the animal before immunization, was used as a control. As shown in Fig. 5C, the
anti-End016 serum reacts with a small set of high mo-

lecular weight proteins, ranging from 180 to >300 kDa.
These bands are not observed in the lane reacted with
preimmune serum. It remains to be determined
whether the multiple bands are the result of degradation, post-translational modification, or common epitopes shared by different proteins. The 6.6-kb End016
mRNA can potentially encode a primary translation
product with a maximum size of 240-250 kDa. Therefore, degradation in the protein sample cannot account
for the higher molecular weight bands observed.
Immunolocalixation of the End016 Gene Product in
Gastrula Stage Embryos
We reacted the anti-End016 serum with fixed, whole,
midgastrula stage embryos in an effort to determine
the spatial and cellular distribution of the End016 gene
product. The reaction was visualized with fluoresceinconjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody and
observed with a fluorescence microscope. The results of
this experiment, shown in Fig. 6, reveal that the End016

protein is ,localized to the surface of endodermal cells of
the archenteron and secondary mesenchyme cells. The
immunolocalization of the End016 protein to the surface of endodermal cells is corroborated by the in situ
hybridization experiments, which detected significant
levels of End016 transcripts in these cells. However,
although the End016 protein appears to be present on
the surface of secondary mesenchyme cells at midgastrula stage (arrows in Fig. 6), these cells do not contain
detectable End016 transcripts (Figs. 4E and 4F). There
are several possible explanations to account for the observation of End016 protein in association with these
cells. At earlier stages of development, our in situ hybridization experiments have shown that the End016
gene is actively transcribed in vegetal plate cells and
the archenteron, which includes the precursors of the
secondary mesenchyme. Long-lived End016 protein,
synthesized by the precursor cells, may persist in the
cells through later stages of development. Alternatively, endodermal cells may be secreting the End016
protein, which subsequently binds to the surface of secondary mesenchyme cells by means of specific receptors
expressed by the secondary mesenchyme.
DISCUSSION

The results of Northern blot experiments demonstrate that the End016 gene is a member of the class of

Sea Urchin Lineage-Speci$c Protein

269

so-called “embryonic late genes” (Davidson, 1986) defined as not being significantly expressed in oocytes but
activated during early development. It is estimated that
not more than 10% of all sequences utilized during
early sea urchin development fall into this class (Flytzanis et ah, 1982). This pattern of expression is characteristic of spatially regulated genes (Davidson, 1986;
Sargent et al, 1986) and in situ hybridization results
confirm that End016 is expressed in a spatially regulated manner. Moreover, the gene is first transcribed in
a group of endodermal and secondary mesenchymal
precursor cells and transcription becomes progressively
restricted to a subset of endoderm cells as development
proceeds. Within the limits of resolution of our technique, we do not observe any differential expression of
End016 among vegetal plate cells at early stages; however, we cannot completely rule out this possibility. Interestingly, the transcript has not been detected in any
adult tissues examined, indicating that the function of
the End016 gene product may be specific to embryogenesis.
Several endoderm-specific markers have been identified previously by M&lay and colleagues using monoclonal antibodies generated against the insoluble fraction of sea urchin plutei and indirect immunofluorescence. Some of these antigens, for example, those
recognized by McAbAAla3 and McAbLLEif7 (McClay
and Wessel, 1984), are first detected in all regions of the
egg and early embryo and only become localized to the
endoderm later in development. Others, such as those
recognized by McAb7B3, McAb4BlO (M&lay and Ettensohn, 1987), and the antigens designated Meso 2 and
Endo 1 (Wessel and M&lay, 1985), are already localized
to the vegetal plate or endoderm when first detected at
mesenchyme blastula or very early gastrula stages. A
recently isolated endoderm-specific cDNA clone, designated Lv1.4 (G. Wessel, personal communication), is
first detected in early gastrula stage embryos and is
present only in the mid- and hindgut regions of the
embryo at all stages of development. The pattern of
End016 expression that we have observed is unique
among endoderm-specific molecules; nevertheless it
does share a feature common to the majority of endodermal markers described to date. With the exceptions
of Endo 1 and Lv1.4, expression of endoderm-specific
markers becomes progressively restricted to a subset of
vegetal plate derivatives as the archenteron differentiates into a tripartite gut and secondary mesenchyme.
The portion of the End016 gene product encoded by
the 794-bp cDNA displays several unique structural
features which may provide clues to the biological
function of the molecule. Overall, this region of the
predicted End016 protein contains a very high density
of negatively charged amino acids, with aspartate and

FIG. 5. Production of anti-End016 polyclonal antiserum. (A) Induction of the TrpE-End016 fusion protein. Whole cell lysates of JMlOl
cells harboring no plasmid (lanes 1 and 2), parental pATH1 plasmid
(lanes 3 and 4), or the fusion construct (lanes 5 and 6) were prepared.
Cultures were induced (lanes 2,4, and 6) by simultaneous tryptophan
starvation and exposure to indoleacrylic acid. Extracts were electrophoresed on 15% SDS-PAGE gels and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue. Molecular weight marker positions are indicated in kilodaltons on the left. Induction of cells harboring the fusion construct
results in production of the expected 60-kDa fusion protein (arrow).
This protein was subsequently purified and used in the production of
a polyclonal antiserum (see Materials and Methods). (B) Specificity of
the polyclonal antiserum. Samples were electrophoresed on 15%
SDS-PAGE gels, electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes and
reacted with preimmune (lane 1) or immune (lanes 2-4) sera, as described under Materials and Methods. Molecular weight markers are
indicated on the left. Lanes 1 and 2,0.4 pg purified Trp-End016 fusion
protein. Lane 3, whole cell extract prepared from E. coli JMlOl strain
harboring pUR288 P-gal expression plasmid. Lane 4, whole cell extract from JMlOl harboring P-gal-End016 expression plasmid. The
anti-End016 serum reacts strongly with both the Trp-End016 and the
&gal-End016 fusion proteins. (C) Detection of the End016 protein in
sea urchin embryonic lysates. Whole cell extracts were prepared from
gastrula stage embryos, electrophoresed on 10% SDS-PAGE gels,
electroblotted to nitrocellulose, and reacted with the anti-End016
serum. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary
antibody was used to visualize the reaction. Lane 1, preimmune
serum. Lane 2, anti-End016 serum. A small set of high molecular
weight, cross-reacting proteins (180-300 kDa) are detected with the
anti-End016 serum.

of the End016 gene product in whole embryos. Whole 36-hr gastrula stage embryos were fixed and reacted with
preimmune (A) or anti-End016 serum (B) as detailed under Materials and Methods. The reaction was visualized with fluorescein-conjugated
goat anti-rabbit
secondary antibody and photographed
under the fluorescence microscope. No fluorescent staining is observed with the
preimmune serum. The anti-End016 serum appears to stain the surfaces of archenteron (a) and secondary mesenchyme (arrows) cells at this
