Abstract In an attempt to identify chemical signals
governing the general flower and silique feeding behavior
of larvae of the orange tip butterfly, Anthocharis cardamines (L.), we investigated feeding behavior and chemistry of two major host plants: Cardamine pratensis L. and
Alliaria petiolata (Bieb.) Cavara & Grande (garlic mustard). Larvae reportedly feed mainly on flowers and siliques
rather than leaves in nature, and did so when observed on
the original host plants. Behavioral experiments, using
detached A. petiolata branches, however, showed that
larvae readily accepted leaves and only the final instar
showed a tendency for directed movement towards floral
parts. To search for semiochemicals that control plant part
preference and to assess possible nutritional consequences
of floral parts feeding, we determined glucosinolate profiles
and total nitrogen levels of floral parts and leaves. There
was only moderate difference between glucosinolate profiles of leaves and floral parts within each of two host plant
species. In contrast, the profiles of floral parts differed
significantly between them. A. petiolata was dominated by
2-propenyl glucosinolate, while C. pratensis was dominated by aromatic glucosinolates and branched aliphatic
glucosinolates, with considerable variation among populations. Nitrogen levels tended to be higher in floral parts
than in leaves in A. petiolata, but not in C. pratensis, so

floral feeding could not generally be attributed to higher N
content. With the exception of a tendency of last instar
larvae (L5) to move to the apex and ingest flowers and
upper stem, we did not find either a plant chemistry basis or
larval acceptance/rejection behavior that could explain the
usual feeding of floral parts by orange tip larvae of all
instars. However, by artificial manipulation of vertical
larval position on host plants, we found that the frequency
of leaf vs. flower feeding during 24 hr depended significantly on the initial larval position. Hence, we suggest that
the placement of eggs on floral parts by ovipositing female
butterflies is a major explanation of orange tip feeding
habits previously known from field observations.

Introduction
The orange tip butterfly, Anthocharis cardamines (L.),
accepts floral parts of a large number of glucosinolate
containing plant species for oviposition, and two plant
species appear to be frequent hosts: Cardamine pratensis L.
(cuckoo flower) and Alliaria petiolata (Bieb.) Cavara &
Grande (garlic mustard) (Wiklund and Åhrberg, 1978;
Courtney, 1981; Dempster, 1997; Wiklund and Friberg,
2009). The larvae usually are described as floral parts
feeders. Indeed, some field observations suggest that leaves
are rejected by the larvae even when all siliques (the fruits
of cruciferous plants) are consumed, thus resulting in death
from starvation (Wiklund and Åhrberg, 1978). The apparent
combination of female and larval preference for floral parts
suggested to us that a chemical signal, perhaps a stimulant,

1336

a deterrent, or an anti-nutritional factor, could be involved
in plant part discrimination.
Glucosinolates, amino acid-derived secondary metabolites
primarily found in the mustard order Brassicales, are crucial
host plant recognition cues for pierid butterflies such as the
cabbage whites (Pieris sp.) and related species (Renwick and
Chew, 1994; Hopkins et al., 2009). Glucosinolate containing
plants often contain a mixture of different structures,
metaphorically known as the glucosinolate ‘profile’, which
often differ between plant organs (e.g., Agerbirk et al.,
2008).
Differential insect behavioral responses and their correlations with variation in individual glucosinolates have
been observed (e.g., under field conditions, Rodman and
Chew, 1980; Griffiths et al., 2001; Bidart-Bouzat and
Kliebenstein, 2008; under laboratory conditions, Huang and
Renwick, 1994; Giamoustaris and Mithen, 1995; Li et al.,
2000; Gols et al., 2008; de Vos et al., 2008; Sun et al., 2009,
but see also Reifenrath et al., 2005; Reifenrath and Städler,
2009; Badenes-Pérez et al., 2010). In one case that involves
a monophagous insect and a glucosinolate of unusual
proposed structure, host plant preference was linked to
presence of a distinct glucosinolate (Larsen et al., 1992).
Thus, there may be a chemosensory basis for evolution of
host plant or plant part discrimination based on differential
sensitivity to individual glucosinolates (Hopkins et al., 2009).
Phytophagous butterfly larvae also have sensory organs for
various primary metabolites (Schoonhoven et al., 2005),
some of which could be correlated to total nitrogen contents
of plant parts.
The purpose of this work was to search for evidence for
a chemical basis of the assumed plant part preferences of
orange tip larvae, and to develop a bioassay for a
hypothetic semiochemical responsible for floral parts
feeding. We pursued this purpose in two parallel ways:
(1) by observation of caterpillar feeding choice on original
host plants and after transfer to various positions on A.
petiolata, and (2) by chemical analysis of plants collected
during the period of orange tip larval occurrence.

Methods and Materials
Identification of Plants and Animals Flowering C. pratensis and A. petiolata were identified in the field from their
characteristic morphologies. Eggs of the orange tip butterfly
were tentatively identified in the field, and the identity
confirmed from comparison of the morphology of the
resulting larvae with the same illustrated descriptions as
used previously (Agerbirk et al., 2006). Selected larvae
were reared to pupation to confirm the identification based
on pupal morphology. Photographs of the studied material
including egg and the transition from larva to pupa have

J Chem Ecol (2010) 36:1335–1345

been published elsewhere (Agerbirk and Jørgensen, 2008).
Four pupae produced four female butterflies the following
spring, all of which were confirmed to be A. cardamines by
morphology.
Collection of Plants Plant shoots of flowering plants (C.
pratensis cut above the rosette and A. petiolata cut below a
number of fresh leaves) were collected in plastic bags at
natural growth sites in May 2008 and transported to the
laboratory within a few hours. Unless otherwise noted, all
plants and animals were from Lake Utterslev Mose (= locality
DK1), Copenhagen, Denmark. A. petiolata was collected
within 20 m of the lake rim (e.g. 55 42′ 57″ N, 12 30′ 22″ E),
while C. pratensis was collected at the public lawns
(“Gyngemosen”) NE of the lake and NW of Highway 16
(e.g. 55 43′ 19″N, 12 29′ 43″E). We also sampled C.
pratensis floral parts from two other, previously described
localities (DK2, DK3) (Agerbirk et al., 2010a). The
individual plants DK3a and DK3b were the same as
described in that paper and were dried without lyophilization
as described in that paper.
Observation of Egg Position and Caterpillar Feeding
Behavior Flowering shoots of C. pratensis and A. petiolata
with orange tip eggs or neonate larvae were collected as
above and kept in individual, numbered beakers with tap
water in the laboratory, and exposed to sunlight through an
east facing glass window. If the orange tip egg could be
located, the position was registered. Most L1/L2 larvae
collected (N=26) were subject to detailed observations on
the original host plants. (However, L1/L2 larvae collected
on days with experimental manipulation of larval position
were used directly in the behavioral experiments, and hence
not observed on the original host plants). The position and
behavior of each larva, as well as signs of feeding, were
observed and noted at least daily between Monday and
Friday, and representative specimens were photographed in
order to illustrate characteristic feeding patterns. The
observations on original host plants typically were carried
out for 2–3 d for an individual larva, after which they were
moved to fresh plants to be used for experiments. It was not
meaningful to standardize the observation period because
the material was collected at different stages, including
eggs, newly hatched larvae, and slightly older larvae.
One intact C. pratensis plant (on the flower of which
oviposition by an orange tip was observed the day before),
with its root system and approximately 1 l of attached soil+
grass, was removed from the locality, and was cultivated in
the laboratory during the entire larval development including
hatching and pupation (May 7–24). The spontaneous feeding
behavior of the resulting larva, which was not manipulated
in any way, was observed 5 d a week. When the remains of
the host plant had been left, A. petiolata was offered for

J Chem Ecol (2010) 36:1335–1345

completion of the 5th instar and pupation (pupal wt.
112 mg), to confirm identification.
Rearing of Larvae for Behavioral Experiments As soon as
or before original plants started to deteriorate visibly, larvae
were gently transferred (with a moist paint brush) to fresh
bolting A. petiolata shoots, collected at the locality 0–2 d
before, and kept in the laboratory immersed in beakers with
tap water. They were exposed to reduced daylight through
an east facing window until use. This stock of larvae,
supplemented with newly collected larvae of various
instars, served as the material for additional behavioral
experiments.
Behavioral Experiments For behavioral experiments,
A. petiolata side branches with a specific morphology and
growth stage were used, with leaves immediately next to
the lower 1–2 siliques (Fig. 1) and with flowers with fresh
petals. As the natural availability of branches with this
morphology (including fresh flowers) ceased late in the
experimental period, we ended this type of experiment even
though additional late instars were available.

Two plant part preference experiments were carried out.
The purpose of the ‘leaf/silique choice experiment’ was to
test whether an absolute preference for silique feeding
could be demonstrated in a choice situation, where both a
silique and a leaf were within close proximity to the larva.
Larvae of known instar were gently transferred to lower
parts of A. petiolata branches (one larva per branch in
separate beakers), with about half of the larvae of each
instar placed on lower siliques and the other half placed on
leaves immediately next to lower siliques (Fig. 1). The
feeding during the 24 hr experimental period was registered
by careful inspection of the branch for feeding traces at the
end of 24 hr. Occasional observation of some larvae during
the experiment also was carried out in order to qualify the
subsequent inspection of the branch for feeding traces.
Selected branches with larva and feeding traces were
photographed with a background 5×5 mm grid after the
experiment, and ingested amounts were estimated by
comparison with un-touched leaves.
The purpose of the ‘vertical position experiment’ was to
test whether the vertical position of the larva, either near the
plant apex with flowers or at lower levels near the leaves,
would influence the subsequent plant part feeding choice of
the larva (as suggested by the outcome of the leaf/silique
choice experiment). Larvae were placed either on the
uppermost silique, near the flowers, or on the lower-most
silique, next to a leaf (Fig. 1). Evaluation of the feeding
choices was as described for the leaf/silique choice
experiment.
Whether or not occurrence of leaf feeding depended on
the initial position of the larva was tested by Rice’s
conditional binomial exact test (Rice, 1988) of 2 ×2
matrixes with leaf feeding vs. no leaf feeding as a function
of larval position. (Fisher’s exact test gave the same pattern
of significance vs. non-significance). The significance level
was set at 5% (two-tailed test), and results for L1-L4 were
pooled because there was no indication of differences
among these instars. Whether or not flower feeding
depended on initial larval position was tested in the same
way.
Plant Sampling and Dissection for Chemical Analysis Plants for chemical analysis were sampled (in parallel to
larvae and plants for behavioral experiments) at the main
study locality (DK1) in May (2008), which was the
oviposition and larval feeding period of orange tip
butterflies at the locality. Plants for chemical analysis were
dissected and lyophilized immediately after arriving in the
laboratory; the time from collection in the field to
dissection and lyophilization was 3 hr or less. In dissection
for chemical analysis, upper stem was defined as the upper
inflorescence (with flowers) and included flower stalks;
middle stem was defined as the lower inflorescence (with

1338

J Chem Ecol (2010) 36:1335–1345

siliques) and included silique stalks; and lower stem was
defined as the basal part of the stem, from the lowermost
silique downwards. Leaves were cauline (stem) leaves, not
rosette leaves. Siliques and flowers included only these
organs, as the stalks attaching them to the stem were
included with stems. For nitrogen analysis of specific plant
organs, we aimed at pooling only from the same individual,
but in the case of flowers, siliques, and upper stems, the
samples in most cases had to be pooled from several
individual plants to provide sufficient amounts for the
analysis.
Determination and Identification of Glucosinolates Glucosinolates were determined by extraction of lyophilized plant
parts in boiling 70% MeOH, binding to anion exchange
columns, enzymatic desulfation, elution (in 5×1 ml H2O)
and subsequent HPLC with diode array detection of desulfo
derivatives relative to an external standard of sinigrin (15)
treated similarly in parallel (Agerbirk et al., 2007). The
exact HPLC conditions were different for the two plant
species: HPLC conditions for C. pratensis samples were
optimized specifically to achieve separation of all glucosinolates known from this species (Agerbirk et al., 2010a).
For A. petiolata, a Supelcosil LC-ABZ column, 25 cm×
4.6 mm, 5 μm, was used with flow rate 1 ml/min, and
elution by 2 min of H2O followed by a 48 min linear
gradient from 0 to 60% MeOH, a brief wash with MeOH,
and equilibration with H2O. Peak identification by comparison with authentic reference compounds supplemented
by LC-MS of selected samples was as previously described
(Agerbirk et al., 2010a). Glucosinolate levels in A. petiolata
were log10-transformed to remedy non-normal distribution
of the original data, and subjected to statistical analysis.
Due to unexpected occurrence of several chemotypes of C.
pratensis with qualitative differences among them, the
various chemotypes were reported separately, and quantitative statistical tests of glucosinolate levels in this plant were
not considered meaningful.
Nitrogen Determination Total nitrogen (and carbon) contents of lyophilized samples from locality DK1 were
determined on an elemental analyzer (Carlo Erba model
NA 1500, Carlo Erba, Milan, Italy) in the laboratory of

USA. Two samples (A. petiolata leaves,%N 3.27, and upper
stems,%N 5.99) deemed unreliable by the analysis-lab due
to abnormal values for associated standards were excluded
from the data and calculations. Numbers for %N were
converted to proportions (0.00–1.00), which were arcsin
transformed to remedy non-normal distribution of the
original data.
Statistical Analysis of Chemical Data Levene’s test was
used to confirm that transformed glucosinolate and nitrogen
levels met the variance homogeneity assumptions of
ANOVA. Differences between nitrogen and glucosinolate
levels among plant parts within each species were examined by ANOVA. Where the ANOVA was significant,
unplanned multiple comparison among plant parts was
made using Scheffé post-hoc test with significance level set
at 0.05. In one case with N=1 for one plant part, this plant
part was excluded before ANOVA with post-hoc test.

Results
Oviposition Site Almost all eggs or egg shells located on C.
pratensis or A. petiolata were on siliques or flowers,
including their basal parts, while a single egg was observed
on a leaf close to a silique (Table 1A). Usually, only a
single egg or larva was observed per plant, but in some
cases two (Fig. 2) or even three orange tip eggs or larvae
were present naturally.
Plant Part Choice on Original Host Plants Feeding habits
of L1/L2 instars on the original host plants nearly always
(88%) included silique feeding. Flower feeding also was
frequent (46%), while only few larvae ate leaves at all
(Table 1B) (but one fed exclusively on a leaf during the first
and the initial part of the 2nd instar). The flower feeding
behavior by early instars on C. pratensis was quite
stereotypic, with the feeding starting from the basal part
of the flower (Fig. 2) whether or not the flower was open.
Floral parts egg position and feeding by orange tips was
obviously dominant for both host plant species, and it was

not considered relevant to test statistically whether slight
differences between patterns on the two plant species
existed. For comparison of plant part distribution with
published field data, see “Discussion”.
The feeding behaviour of a single larva through all five
instars on an intact C. pratensis plant complemented the
observations. In the first three instars (L1-L3), the larva ate
flowers and siliques. The 4th instar (L4) also ate upper
stem, and 5th (final) instar (L5) ate the remaining stem
except the lower 9 cm (ca. one third) as well as all cauline
leaves and part of the rosette leaves.
Leaf/Silique Choice Experiment The probability of leaf
feeding was not significantly different for larvae placed
initially on a leaf vs. larvae placed initially on a nearby
silique (P=0.21). Irrespective of their initial position, larvae
frequently ingested leaves as well as siliques (Table 2A).
The amounts of leaf ingested were typically substantial i.e.,
more than the minute test bites seen when another species

of insect larvae probed unacceptable Barbarea vulgaris
plants (Agerbirk et al., 2003). Flower feeding was infrequent for L2-L4 instars in this experiment. Apparently, the
frequency of feeding on each plant part was a consequence
of a limited mobility within 24 hr, and was sufficient to
reach the leaf even when they were placed at the silique and
vice-versa, but was generally insufficient to reach the more
distant flowers.
A single L5 larva was included in the experiment, but
was not included in the pooled results for statistical testing
due to its atypical behavior: The individual was placed on
the leaf next to the lower silique, from which approximately
3 cm2 (ca. 1/5 of the entire leaf) was eaten. Rather than
eating the remaining leaf or neighboring silique, it moved
overnight to the flowers and upper siliques, which were
ingested entirely. This observation led us to include as
many L5 larvae as available in the vertical position
experiment.
Vertical Position Experiment This experiment, in which
larvae were placed on either lower or upper siliques,
confirmed the importance of larval position inferred above.
Young to intermediate instars (L1-L4) placed near leaves
exhibited frequent leaf feeding (50%) and no flower
feeding, while larvae placed near flowers exhibited frequent
flower feeding (45%) and no leaf feeding (Table 2B). The
probability of leaf feeding was significantly higher when
larvae were placed on lower siliques than when placed on
upper siliques (P=0.01). Likewise, the probability of flower
feeding was significantly higher when larvae were placed
on upper siliques compared to lower siliques (P=0.015).
Based on the combined experiments, we concluded that any
preference of L1-L4 larvae for floral parts (siliques and
flowers) would be too weak to be of practical use in a
bioassay for a hypothetic stimulant or deterrent. Indeed,

feeding choice by young and intermediate instars (L1-L4)
seemed to be governed mainly by proximity, at least under
our laboratory conditions.
Seven available L5 larvae also were included in the
vertical position experiment, and all except one (from lower
silique) moved to flowers and ingested the entire upper part
of the inflorescence within 24 hr, while only a single had
eaten from leaves (Table 2B). For this instar, the probability
of flower feeding did not depend on the initial position of
the larvae (P=0.94). Despite the low number of replicates,
we interpret this result as a tendency for L5 instars to prefer
floral parts.
Glucosinolate Profiles of Leaves and Floral Parts The two
main hosts of orange tip butterflies at the DK1 locality, an
urban lake habitat in the greater Copenhagen area, appeared
to be A. petiolata and C. pratensis. There was no difference
in the kinds of glucosinolates in vegetative or floral parts of
A. petiolata, but when the levels were compared, there was
a significant effect of the plant parts in statistical analysis
by ANOVA. Flowers and upper stems contained higher
levels of the major glucosinolate sinigrin (15) and the
phenolic indole glucosinolate 12 (with proportional traces
of 10) relative to leaves (Table 3, Fig. 3).
In the other common host plant at the locality, C.
pratensis, the mixture of glucosinolates was more complex.
Plants from the main locality (DK1) contained three dominant
glucosinolates – the phenolic glucosinolate sinalbin (8), the
O-methyl derivative 9, and the hydroxylated aliphatic
glucosinolate 4 – and a number of minor glucosinolates
including the indole glucosinolate 10 (Table 4, Fig. 3). The
glucosinolate profiles of floral and vegetative parts were
similar, with no obvious indications of a particular glucosinolate profile or higher glucosinolate level of floral parts.
As a hypothetic floral parts signature was expected to be
of general nature, we included floral parts of the same plant

Statistical significance of differences in major glucosinolates between
plant parts were tested by ANOVA (P<0.001: ***, P<0.01: **, P<
0.05: *, P>0.05: ns, not tested: -). Significant differences in a post-hoc
Scheffé test (P<0.05) are indicated with different letters

species from other localities (DK2, DK3). Floral parts of
individual C. pratensis plants from these localities showed
qualitative differences from both floral parts and leaves at
the main locality in terms of glucosinolate profiles. In a
plant from locality DK2, sec-butylglucosinolate (3) rather
than the hydroxy derivative 4 was the dominating aliphatic
glucosinolate in flowers. At locality DK3, flowers of two
individual plants had glucosinolate profiles that deviated
even more from those at locality DK1, as the methylated
aromatic glucosinolate 9 was nearly absent (Table 4). Plant
DK3a accumulated benzylglucosinolate (7) and a short
chain hydroxylated aliphatic glucosinolate (2) in flowers
while both 3 and 4 were absent. In contrast, plant DK3b
accumulated the non-hydroxylated 3 but not 7. The
distinctive profiles of floral parts from localities DK2 and
DK3 were similar to leaf glucosinolate profiles of the same
plants reported elsewhere (Agerbirk et al., 2010a).
Nitrogen Levels in Different Plant Parts In A. petiolata,
total N content was higher in upper stems than in leaves,
and there was also a tendency for high N levels in flowers.
In the case of C. pratensis, however, there was no
statistically significant difference in N content among floral
parts and leaves (Table 5).

Discussion
An initial purpose of the behavioral experiments was to
establish a bioassay for a hypothetic semiochemical
(Agerbirk et al., 2003; Miles et al., 2005; Nielsen et al.,
2010) responsible for floral parts feeding. Branches of A.
petiolata (Fig. 1) with adjoining lower siliques and upper
leaves (in contrast to the distance between these organs on
the main stem), as well as a controlled laboratory
environment, were used in an attempt to maximize the
sensitivity for any larval preference. However, the larval
feeding behavior seemed to be governed mainly by the
position of the larvae in laboratory experiments with young
and intermediate instar larvae (L1-L4). We believe that the
laboratory test situation was relatively similar to the natural
situation in terms of physical conditions and plant chemistry because relatively fresh A. petiolata branches were
used. It can be argued that biochemical changes in the
detached A. petiolata branches kept in the laboratory may
have compromised a semiochemical responsible for plant
part preference. Obvious consequences of the laboratory
rearing at lower light intensity and significantly less UV
light than in the field could be decreases in levels of
photosynthetic products or UV induced metabolites with a
significant turnover rate. Indeed, a recent experiment used
for demonstrating specific movement to flowers of third

instar Pieris brassicae (Smallegange et al., 2007) involved
intact plants (in a greenhouse). However, the feeding on
detached original host plants kept in the laboratory was
almost exclusively from floral parts, suggesting that even if
plant biochemistry changed due to the laboratory conditions, the positional effect was sufficient to enable the
larvae to behave as in the field. Hence, biochemical
changes due to the laboratory conditions are not likely to
have influenced the plant part choices of the larvae. In

agreement with this argument, the spontaneous behavior of
young larvae, when their position had not been manipulated,
agreed well with published field observations (Wiklund and
Åhrberg, 1978; Courtney, 1981; Dempster, 1997), except
that Dempster (1997) described floral feeding to precede
silique feeding in general on C. pratensis. This slight
difference from our observations may depend on local
conditions such as relative phenologies of insect and host
plant (Wiklund and Friberg, 2009).

Statistical significance of differences in major glucosinolates between
plant parts were tested by ANOVA (P<0.001: ***, P<0.01: **, P<
0.05: *, P>0.05: ns). Significant differences in a post-hoc Scheffé test
(P<0.05) are indicated with different letters. a The level of significance
was *** whether or not lower stem was excluded in ANOVA.

The feeding behavior of the single larva followed through
all instars on the same plant immediately suggested a
biological advantage for flexible feeding behavior. The
inflorescence of the C. pratensis individual chosen by the
female was too small to support full development of the larva
if only siliques and flowers were ingested. Larval migration
to other plants would be needed if only floral parts were
accepted, but such movement to other, perhaps distant plants
poses an obvious risk (Wiklund and Åhrberg, 1978;
Dempster, 1997). Hence, utilization of vegetative parts would
allow larvae to avoid or delay risky migration. Although this
observation of a single larva can be dismissed due to lack of
replication, we find it of interest and worthy of additional
investigation as a complement to the traditional assumption
of the existence of leaf avoidance (Wiklund and Åhrberg,
1978). The outcome of our experimental manipulations and
the observation of occasional leaf feeding by young larvae on
original host plant shoots (Table 1) confirm the observed
spontaneous leaf acceptance by orange tip larvae.
The apparent preference for flowers by L5 larvae was
reminiscent of a similar behavior reported for Pieris brassicae
L3 and Athalia rosae L4 larvae (Smallegange et al., 2007;
Bandeili and Müller, 2010), and suggests that proximity was
not the only factor controlling orange tip L5 larval feeding.
The most direct advantage of the tendency for feeding from
the top would be to avoid accidental cutting of the main
plant axis by the vigorously feeding L5 instars, which would
lead to loss of the upper parts of the plant. As usual for late
instar caterpillars (Theunissen et al., 1985), L5 larvae
ingested a tremendous amount of material. In this case it
was comparable to the remaining parts (after feeding by
previous instars) of the relatively small C. pratensis. Thus, a
strong plant part preference might have little effect on this
plant species, because the majority of the plant (except tough

lower parts) would likely be ingested during the L5
developmental stage. In contrast, A. petiolata individuals
were substantially larger plants, and floral parts preference
by L5 larvae could be a means to ensure that potentially
nutritious apical parts were prioritized. A similar benefit in
terms of larval nutrition could be a consequence of the
female’s choice of floral parts for oviposition. This hypothesis is assessed below in light of our data on glucosinolate
profiles and nitrogen content of plant parts. These analyses
also represent an independent search for a semiochemical
responsible for floral parts feeding.
A comparison of the glucosinolate profiles of vegetative and
floral parts of two host plant species revealed no consistent
floral parts glucosinolate profile. Based on the analyses of the
chemically simple A. petiolata, a preliminary hypothesis for a
hypothetic glucosinolate ‘signature’ or profile of floral parts
could be a higher total level of glucosinolates, or a higher
level of indole glucosinolates (10–14) or perhaps of aromatic
(7–14) or phenolic (8+12) glucosinolates in general. Based on
the literature, a different balance of aromatic vs. aliphatic
glucosinolates (van Loon et al., 1992; Huang and Renwick,
1994) or of O-methylated vs. non-substituted aromatics (Sun
et al., 2009) would be candidate signatures that could possibly
be distinguished by insect sensory organs. Based on
separately reported analytical chemistry research (Agerbirk
et al., 2010a), we obtained reliable glucosinolate profiles of C.
pratensis floral parts and leaves. However, none of the
hypotheses of a floral parts ‘signature’ was supported when
data for three populations of C. pratensis were considered.
From the data in Table 4, a tendency for higher levels of 10 in
floral parts than in leaves is suggested, but levels of 10 were
higher in leaves than in floral parts in the individual plants
from locality DK2 and 3 (Agerbirk et al., 2010a; unpublished
results), so a hypothesis of a role of 10 was not generally
supported. Indeed, the difference in glucosinolate profile
between the two species and between individuals from
different populations of C. pratensis appeared to be much
greater than any systematic differences between vegetative
and floral parts (Table 4). Consequently, there appears to be
no basis for using glucosinolate profiles for larval distinction
of floral parts from leaves.
A similar glucosinolate profile of flowers and vegetative
parts, with a general tendency for higher levels in flowers
of undamaged plants, also had been reported from
Arabidopsis thaliana, Raphanus sativus, Brassica nigra,
and Sinapis alba (Brown et al., 2003; Strauss et al., 2004;
Smallegange et al., 2007; Bandeili and Müller, 2010).
Glucosinolates were constitutively high but generally less
inducible in radish flowers compared to leaves, as expected
for an organ with high fitness value (Strauss et al., 2004).
Our data do not exclude the possibility that floral parts
could be deficient in the enzyme myrosinase (which
converts glucosinolates to defensive products such as

J Chem Ecol (2010) 36:1335–1345

isothiocyanates), but a recent report demonstrated high
levels of myrosinase in floral parts of the crucifer S. alba
(Bandeili and Müller, 2010), showing that floral parts high
in glucosinolates may indeed also be high in myrosinase.
It was a surprise to discover that C. pratensis plants from
different localities had different glucosinolate profiles; a
more extensive investigation of glucosinolate variation in
the species is published separately (Agerbirk et al., 2010a).
Two subspecies of C. pratensis with different chromosome
numbers had different probabilities of oviposition by
orange tip butterfly females in Sweden (Arvanitis et al.,
2007, 2008), but the C. pratensis populations at three
Danish localities investigated here had identical chromosome numbers (Agerbirk et al., 2010a).
In A. petiolata, there was a tendency for higher N
contents in upper parts, although the difference from leaves
was statistically significant only for upper stems (which
were frequently eaten by late instar orange tip larvae).
Given the low number of replicates, this result should be
interpreted with caution. However, the A. petiolata parts
high in N were also high in glucosinolates and were both
from the plant apex, suggesting that the measured tendency
reflects a real biological phenomenon. As nitrogen is
considered to be a limiting resource for herbivorous insects
(Mattson, 1980), floral parts feeding may thus be a
nutritional advantage in the case of feeding on A. petiolata.
Position-dependent levels of nitrogen and glucosinolates
also have been reported by Traw and Feeny (2008) for
various leaf-positions of Brassica nigra and B. kaber (syn.
Sinapis arvensis). However, in the case of C. pratensis,
floral parts did not have higher total N than leaves (Table 4).
Hence, our data do not support the hypothesis that floral
parts feeding in general provide a nutritional advantage for
orange tip larvae in terms of N content.
Nutritionally available N can only be approximated by
total N if the majority of plant N is in a form available for
protein or nucleotide biosynthesis; N in secondary metabolites
may not be available for such biosynthesis. Intake of nitrogen
in glucosinolates by orange tips and related species is
balanced 1:1 by excretion of nitrogen in a nitrile (Agerbirk
et al., 2006), a nitrile-derived functional group (Vergara et al.,
2006; Agerbirk et al., 2007), or possibly inorganic ammonia
from hydrolysis of nitrile groups (Agerbirk et al., 2010b).
However, even a high glucosinolate level of 100 μmol/g dry
wt. would correspond only to 0.14% N for non-indoles (and
0.28% N for the indoles 10–14), so glucosinolate N was only
a low fraction of the total N content of any plant part and
total N could be regarded as a proxy of nutritionally
available N. This result agreed with another investigation
(Traw and Feeny, 2008).
In summary, we found a tendency for floral parts
preference for L5 larvae, but no evidence for any L1-L4
larval behavioral preference for floral parts. For a classical

1343

example of a floral parts feeding butterfly, it was surprising
that the feeding preferences of the larvae were so unspecific
compared to the recently discovered within-plant selective
foraging by intermediate to late instar P. brassicae and A.
rosae (Smallegange et al., 2007; Bandeili and Müller,
2010). If the tendency of late instars to move to flowers is a
real phenomenon, it still is not certain that a chemical signal
is involved; we did not, for example, test the effect of
positioning the inflorescences up-side down (Bandeili and
Müller, 2010). Much of the natural tendency for young
orange tip larvae for floral parts feeding can apparently be
attributed to the choice of floral parts for oviposition by
female butterflies (Wiklund and Åhrberg, 1978). Having
established that floral parts are as rich and diverse in
glucosinolates as vegetative parts, the wide range of host
plants used by orange tip butterflies may imply that there is
no basis for selection of a chemically less well defended
plant part (Courtney and Chew, 1987). However, flower
feeding recently has been demonstrated to lead to faster
growth of two species of glucosinolate adapted larvae
(Smallegange et al., 2007; Bandeili and Müller, 2010),
supporting a hypothesized overall nutritional or microenvironmental benefit of feeding on floral parts.
Alternative explanations for flower oviposition in
Anthocharis could be phylogenetic conservatism (the entire
clade of anthocharines and euchloeines oviposits on floral
and fruiting parts), perhaps due to mutual dependency with
other behavioral patterns such as the “red egg syndrome”
(Shapiro, 1981; Nomakuchi et al., 2001) or an optimized
host plant search strategy: exclusive investigation of
flowers may save valuable time during the oviposition
period or allow the search for nectar source plants (Wiklund
and Åhrberg, 1978) and plants for oviposition to be
combined. The present demonstration of flexible but
position-dependent larval plant part choice, glucosinolate
diversity in floral parts and variable but relatively high N
levels in floral parts underlines the importance of the
positioning of eggs by ovipositing females, and shows that
crucifer floral parts may be as diverse and well defended as
crucifer foliage.
